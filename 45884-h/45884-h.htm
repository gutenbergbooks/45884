<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>
<p>The intricate coast-line of England, so difficult for an enemy to blockade,
  so difficult at every point for combined naval and military forces
  to defend against raiders, presents to the student of history an extremely
  interesting subject. It is to its insularity that England owes something
  of its greatness, and to the great length of its coast-line that its
  vulnerability is due.</p>
<p>The present book represents the results of a study of the methods and
  means by which England, from Roman times down to the early years of
  the nineteenth century, has defended her shores against various over-sea
  enemies, who have attempted, sometimes successfully, to invade and
  conquer.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="mf"><a name="PREHISTORIC_CAMPS" id="PREHISTORIC_CAMPS">PREHISTORIC CAMPS</a></h3>

<p>Round the coast of England there are many prehistoric earthworks of great
  extent and strength. These fall generally under the heads of hill-top
  fortresses and promontory camps. The works comprised under the former
  head are so arranged as to take the greatest possible advantage of
  natural hill-tops, often of large size. On the line where the comparatively
  level top developed into a more or less precipitous slope a deep ditch
  was dug, and the earth so removed was in most cases thrown outwards
  so as to form a rampart which increased the original difficulties of
  the sloping hill-side.</p>
<p>The latter type of earthwork, called promontory camps from their natural
  conformation, were strengthened by the digging of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[
  4]</a></span> deep ditch, so as to cut off the promontory from the
  main table-land from which it projected, and in some cases the sides
  of the camp were made more precipitous by artificial scarping.</p>
<p>An examination of these types of earthworks leads to the conclusion that
  they were probably tribal enclosures for the safe-guarding of cattle,
  etc.; that, strictly speaking, they were not military works at all,
  and, in any case, had no relation to national defence against enemies
  coming over-sea.</p>
<p>One finds in different parts of the country a prevalent tradition that
  the Romans occupied the more ancient British hill-top strongholds,
  and the name &ldquo;Caesar&rsquo;s Camp&rdquo; is popularly applied to many
  of them. If such an occupation really took place it was, in all probability,
  only of a temporary character. These fortifications were not suitable
  to the Roman method of military operations and encampment, and such
  archaeological evidences of Roman occupation as have been found point
  to the presence of domestic buildings, such as at Chanctonbury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[
  5]</a></span> Ring and Wolstanbury Camp (Sussex) rather than military
  works.</p>
<p>However, the question must not be dismissed as entirely without some foundation
  in fact, because it was only natural that the Roman invaders who dispossessed
  the Britons of their fastnesses should themselves have taken temporary
  possession of the works from which the Britons were driven out.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="mf"><a name="THE_ROMAN_INVASION_OF" id="THE_ROMAN_INVASION_OF">THE ROMAN
  INVASION OF BRITAIN</a></h3>

<p>There is hardly a single detail of the first invasion of Britain by the
  Romans which has not been the subject of dispute or discussion among
  historians and antiquaries, but, briefly, it may be stated as highly
  probable that Caesar left Portus Itius (Boulogne) on 25 August 55 <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span>,
  and landed at or near what is now Deal on the following day.</p>
<p>When Caesar found a convenient time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[
  6]</a></span> the invasion of Britain, he got together
  about eighty transports, which he considered would be sufficient
  for carrying two legions across the channel. Those galleys
  which he had left he distributed to the questor, lieutenants,
  and officers of the cavalry. In addition to these ships
  there were eighteen transports, detained by contrary winds
  at a port about eight miles off, and these were appointed
  to carry over the cavalry.</p>
<p>A favourable breeze sprang up, and anchor was weighed about one in the
  morning. The cavalry in the eighteen other transports embarked at the
  other port. It was ten o&rsquo;clock when Caesar reached the coast of Britain,
  where he saw the cliffs covered with the enemy&rsquo;s forces. He speaks
  of the place as being bounded by steep mountains in a way which clearly
  describes Dover and the eminences in its neighbourhood, comprising
  Shakespeare&rsquo;s Cliff, the western and eastern heights, and all the magnificent
  cliff of precipitous chalk rock which extends to Kingsdown, near Walmer.
  On such a coast as this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[
  7]</a></span> apart from the presence of the enemy, landing was impossible,
  and Caesar wisely determined to sail eight miles further on, where
  he found, probably at Deal, a plain and open shore. Caesar&rsquo;s description
  is most interesting, and may be quoted:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>&ldquo;But the barbarians perceiving our design, sent their cavalry
    and chariots before, which they frequently make use of in battle,
    and following with the rest of their forces, endeavoured to oppose
    our landing: and indeed we found the difficulty very great on
    many accounts; for our ships being large, required a great depth
    of water; and the soldiers, who were wholly unacquainted with
    the places, and had their hands embarrassed and loaden with a
    weight of armour, were at the same time to leap from the ships,
    stand breast high against the waves, and encounter the enemy,
    while they, fighting upon dry ground, or advancing only a little
    way into the water, having the free use of all their limbs, and
    in places which they perfectly knew, could boldly cast their
    darts, and spur on their horses, well inured to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[
    8]</a></span> kind of service. All these circumstances serving
    to spread a terror among our men, who were wholly strangers to
    this way of fighting, they pushed not the enemy with the same
    vigour and spirit as was usual for them in combats upon dry ground.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Caesar, observing this, ordered some galleys, a kind of shipping
    less common with the barbarians, and more easily governed and
    put in motion, to advance a little from the transports towards
    the shore, in order to set upon the enemy in flank, and by means
    of their engines, slings, and arrows, drive them to some distance.
    This proved of considerable service to our men, for what with
    the surprise occasioned by the make of our galleys, the motion
    of the oars, and the playing of the engines, the enemy were forced
    to halt, and in a little time began to give back. But our men
    still demurring to leap into the sea, chiefly because of the
    depth of the water in those parts, the standard-bearer of the
    tenth legion, having first invoked the gods for success, cried
    out aloud: &lsquo;Follow me, fellow-soldiers, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[
    9]</a></span> you will betray the Roman eagle into the hands
    of the enemy; for my part, I am resolved to discharge my duty
    to Caesar and the common-wealth.&rsquo; Upon this he jumped into the
    sea, and advanced with the eagle against the enemy: whereat,
    our men exhorted one another to prevent so signal a disgrace,
    all that were in the ship followed him, which being perceived
    by those in the nearest vessels, they also did the like, and
    boldly approached the enemy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The battle was obstinate on both sides; but our men, as being
    neither able to keep their ranks, nor get firm footing, nor follow
    their respective standards, because leaping promiscuously from
    their ships, every one joined the first ensign he met, were thereby
    thrown into great confusion. The enemy, on the other hand, being
    well acquainted with the shallows, when they saw our men advancing
    singly from the ships, spurred on their horses, and attacked
    them in that perplexity. In one place great numbers would gather
    round a handful of Romans; others falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[
    10]</a></span> upon them in flank, galled them mightily with
    their darts, which Caesar observing, ordered some small boats
    to be manned, and ply about with recruits. By this means the
    foremost ranks of our men having got footing, were followed by
    all the rest, when falling upon the enemy briskly, they were
    soon put to the rout. But as the cavalry were not yet arrived,
    we could not pursue or advance far into the island, which was
    the only thing wanting to render the victory complete.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Sea-fighting was not unknown to the Romans, but as far as the invasion
  of Britain was concerned, Caesar&rsquo;s fleet may be regarded as a collection
  of ships for transport purposes rather than a fighting naval force.
  The main object of Caesar was to land his soldiers so that they might
  encounter and vanquish the enemy on dry land. This, as the graphic
  words of the &ldquo;Commentaries&rdquo; clearly tell, was quickly accomplished.
  The British method of fighting, in which chariots were employed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[
  11]</a></span> the attack, is described by Caesar,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who
  was evidently impressed by their skilful combination of rapid and awe-inspiring
  attack with the freedom and mobility of light infantry.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that Caesar says nothing about coast defences in the
  form of earthworks, or indeed in any other form, and it is on other
  grounds improbable that the Britons possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[
  12]</a></span> any provision of that kind against invading enemies,
  although they themselves lived in stockaded enclosures.</p>
<p>The Romans were the first people to introduce anything like general coast defence
  in Britain, and in this, as in all other branches of their military
  enterprises, they displayed great skill, intelligence, and thoroughness.
  For the defence of the coast of the eastern and southern parts of Britain
  they erected a chain of castra or fortresses extending from Brancaster,
  on the north-west coast of Norfolk, to Porchester, situated on the
  extreme north-west shore of Portsmouth Harbour.</p>
<p>The position of the various fortresses shows that it was not necessary,
  according to the Roman plan of defence, that one fort should command
  views of its neighbours. Reculver and Richborough, Richborough and
  Dover, Dover and Lymne, Lymne and Pevensey, were in no case visible
  from each other, although the distance which separated them was not
  great in every case. Under these circumstances it is not remarkable
  to find evidences,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[
  13]</a></span> as will presently be explained, of special provision
  for signalling between the fortresses.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="mf"><a name="THE_COUNT_OF_THE_SAXON_SHORE" id="THE_COUNT_OF_THE_SAXON_SHORE">THE
  COUNT OF THE SAXON SHORE</a></h3>

<p>During the early part of the Roman occupation of Britain the chief mode
  of defence adopted against piratical incursions was the navy, <i>classis
  Britannica</i>. This, for the most part, moved in those waters which
  lay between the British and Gaulish coasts, answering to what we now
  know as the Straits of Dover and the southern part of the North Sea.</p>
<p>For a time the navy was able to keep the seas free from pirates, but towards
  the end of the third century the trouble became greater than ever.
  Raiders came in large numbers both to our own coasts and also to the
  Continental coasts opposite, to both of which the name of the Saxon
  Shore was given. The Romans decided to take strong measures to put
  an end to the trouble. For this purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[
  14]</a></span> they appointed a special officer, one Marcus Aurelius
  Valerius Carausius, commonly known by his last name.</p>
<p>The appearance of Carausius on the stage of history brings into prominence
  a man of strong but unscrupulous character. He is believed to have
  allowed the pirates to carry on their work of plunder at their pleasure,
  and then, having waited for the proper moment, he relieved them of
  their booty on the return journey. In this way he acquired great riches,
  and in due course he employed the fleet, not against the enemy of Rome,
  but against Rome, and in such a way as to render Britain independent.
  After several ineffectual attempts to break his power, Diocletian and
  Maximianus found it necessary to recognize him as their colleague in
  the empire, a triumph which Carausius commemorated by striking a medal
  bearing as a device three busts with appropriate emblems the legend:</p>

<table summary="legend" style="border-collapse: collapse" id="table1" border="0">

  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Carausius was murdered by his chief official,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[
  15]</a></span> Allectus, in the year 293. Shortly after
  his death, and when the British province had ceased to
  be independent of Rome, an official was appointed called
  the Count of the Saxon Shore.</p>
<p>This officer, whose title was <i>Comes Littoris Saxonici</i>, was a high
  official whose duty it was to command the defensive forces and supervise
  the fortresses erected on the east, south-east, and south coasts of
  England against the piratical raids of the various tribes of Saxons
  and others during the latter part of the Roman occupation of Britain.
  The precise nature of his duties and the full extent of his authority
  are equally unknown, but they probably comprised the general oversight
  and command both of the fortresses on the British coast from the northern
  coast of Norfolk to a point near Portsmouth, and the navy which guarded
  our shores.</p>
<p>Opinions are divided on the question as to what was precisely meant by
  the phrase &ldquo;the Saxon shore.&rdquo; Was it, as some think, those
  parts of the shore of Britain and Gaul on which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[
  16]</a></span> being specially subject to Saxon raiders, defences were
  erected or employed for repelling the invaders? Or was it, as others
  have supposed, perhaps with less probability, a strip of territory
  following the line of coast nearest the sea on which the Saxons were
  allowed to settle in late Roman times?</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="mf"><a name="ROMAN_COAST_FORTRESSES" id="ROMAN_COAST_FORTRESSES">ROMAN COAST
  FORTRESSES</a></h3>

<p>A careful examination of the fortresses which protected the line of coast
  to which reference has been made, is likely, we think, to afford some
  light upon the above-mentioned point.</p>
<p>If we pay attention to the plans of these fortresses, it will be obvious
  that at least two, Reculver and Brancaster, belong to a type of Roman
  fortress which is associated with a period much earlier than the time,
  as far as we know, when Saxon or other raiders began to molest the
  coasts of Britain and Gaul. Perhaps it is significant that these two
  castra command the entrance to two of the great water ways on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[
  17]</a></span> our east coast, the Thames and the Wash. The other seven
  fortresses, judging from their plans, belong to a later stage of development
  in Roman military architecture.</p>
<p>From this and other features already described we may infer that the whole
  series of fortresses was built at different periods, and probably in
  the following order:</p>

<table summary="castle_build_order" cellpadding="5" style="border-collapse: collapse" id="table2" border="0">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Reculver.</td>
      <td style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 2px">Richborough.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Brancaster.</td>
      <td style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 2px">Lymne.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Porchester.</td>
      <td style="border-left-style: solid; border-left-width: 2px">Pevensey.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Unfortunately, the architectural remains of the remaining castra are not
  sufficiently perfect to allow of classification.</p>
<p>One or two of the coast fortresses, such as Pevensey and Lymne, may well
  have been erected towards the close of the Roman occupation. It is
  significant that tiles bearing the impressed name of Honorius have
  been found built into the walls of Pevensey, pointing to the lateness
  of the building of at least some of the masonry at that castrum.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>
<p>At Lymne early inscriptions, etc. have been found built into the walls,
  indicating a period if not late in the Roman period, at least a considerable
  time after the date of the inscribed stones which were enclosed, as
  mere building material, in the walls. This is corroborated by indications
  of adhering barnacles, from which we may fairly conclude that there
  was a period of submergence between the time of the carving and the
  subsequent use as building material.</p>
<p>It seems probable, therefore, that although the earlier fortresses may
  have been intended to serve as centres for the Roman army, they may
  have been supplemented at a later period by other castra, forming altogether
  a chain of defences intended to protect the shores of Britain against
  Saxon invaders.</p>
<p>The late Mr. G. E. Fox, F.S.A., who made a special study of the subject,
  writes as follows:<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>&ldquo;By the last quarter of the third century the Romano-British
    fleet, on which no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[
    19]</a></span> dependence had been placed for the protection
    of the east and south coasts from raids by plundering bands of
    rovers from over the seas, had evidently failed to afford that
    protection. Whether it was that the fleet was not numerous enough,
    or for whatever reason, the Roman government determined to supplement
    its first line of defence by a second, and this was achieved
    by the erection of forts capable of holding from 500 to 1,000
    men each, on points of the coast-line extending from the mouth
    of the Wash to Pevensey on the coast of Sussex. The coast-line
    indicated received the name of <i>Litus Saxonicum</i>, and the
    nine fortresses which guarded it are called &lsquo;the forts of the
    Saxon Shore.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be observed that the various fortresses in this chain of defensive
  works occur at irregular distances on or near the coast-line, and on
  examination it will be found that in most cases good reason exists
  for the selection of the various sites.</p>

<h4>1. <span class="smcap">Branodunum</span></h4>

<p>There is sufficient evidence to identify the Roman fort of Branodunum
  with some ruins lying to the east of Brancaster, a village situated
  near the north-western corner of Norfolk, on the shores of the Wash.
  The only early mention of the place is found in the
  &ldquo;Notitia Imperii,&rdquo; a catalogue of the distribution of the
  imperial military, naval, and civilian officers throughout the Roman
  world. From this remarkable work, a compilation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[
  21]</a></span> has come down to us from a very early period, it appears
  that the &ldquo;Comes Littoris Saxonici&rdquo;
  (the Count of the Saxon Shore) had under him nine subordinate officers,
  called Praepositi, distributed round the coasts of Norfolk, Essex,
  Kent, Sussex, and Hampshire. The fortress at Brancaster is now in a
  very much ruined state, and but little can be gathered of its original
  form from a casual or superficial examination. Excavations and careful
  searches made about the middle of the nineteenth century brought to
  light many facts about its plan.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The
  fortress was a square of 190 yards and the angles were irregularly
  rounded. Exclusive of ashlar, the walls were found to be 10 feet thick,
  and bounded with large blocks of white sandstone. At one of the roughly
  rounded angles the ashlar facing remained intact. It consisted of blocks
  of sandstone firmly set in mortar with joints of three inches minimum
  thickness.</p>
<p>Traces were found within the walls of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[
  22]</a></span> apartments adjoining the main walls into
  which the smaller walls were regularly bonded, pointing
  to contemporaneity of the work.</p>

<p>Two facts of some importance are proved by the excavations, viz. (1) the
  strength of the fortress as a defensive work, and (2) the simple and
  early character of the plan. Traces of gates were observed in the eastern
  and western walls.</p>

<p class="space-above">Now known as Burgh Castle, is situated in Suffolk near the point where
  the rivers Yare and Waveney fall into Breydon Water. The lines of its
  walls enclose a space, roughly speaking, 660 feet by 330 feet, over
  four acres. It is generally considered to be one of the most perfect
  Roman buildings remaining in the kingdom. The walls in places remain
  to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> a
  height of 9 feet, and their foundations are no less than 12 feet in
  thickness. The bastions, or perhaps more correctly, towers, which flank
  the gates and support the rounded angles of the walls are of peculiar,
  pear-shaped plan. They are solid, and to the height of about 7 feet
  are not tied into the walls. Above that height, however, they are bonded
  into the walls with which, curious as it may appear, they are undoubtedly
  coeval. It is noteworthy that there are two bastions on the east side
  and one each on the north and south sides, and that they, six in all,
  are provided with a hole in the top, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep, indicating
  in all probability that they once mounted turntables upon which ballistae
  were placed for the defence of the fortress.</p>

  namely, a rubble core with courses of bonding tiles, and an outer facing

<p>Gariannonum was a place of great importance in Roman times. Here was stationed
  the captain of the Stablesian horse, styled Gariannonensis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[
  25]</a></span> under the command of <i>Comes littoris Saxonici</i>.</p>
<p><i>Walton.</i>&#8212;Near Felixstow, situated on what is now the fore-shore,
  but which originally was a cliff 100 feet high, and commanding extensive
  views of the surrounding country, are the ruins of what was an important
  Roman station. Although possibly not ranking as one of the nine great
  coast fortresses, it occupied a most important site for the defence
  of this part of the east coast of Britain, and commanded not only the
  entrance to the River Deben, but also all the adjacent coast to the
  south of it. Almost every trace of the station has now been obliterated
  by the waves, but from plans which have been preserved it appears that
  its plan was that of an oblong with towers or bastions at each angle.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<h4>3. <span class="smcap">Othona</span></h4>

<p>Or Ithanchester, near Bradwell-on-Sea, in Essex, was another important
  member of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[

  of the Rivers Blackwater and Colne. Little now remains of Othona, although
  it is on record that the fortress enclosed an area of 4 acres, and
  that its walls possessed foundations no less than 14 feet in thickness.</p>
<p>The defence of such a point as this against the incursions of foes was
  a matter of much importance, because this was a point on the coast
  of Britain specially susceptible to attack by marauders, and, as we
  shall see, special precautions were taken against attacks of this kind.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 3. PLAN OF
  ROMAN BUILDING, WEST MERSEA, ESSEX</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">At a distance of about four miles to the north of Othona, across the estuary
  of the River Blackwater, lies the island of Mersea. In the year 1896
  some Roman foundations were accidentally discovered in the western
  part of the island which, upon examination, appear to have an important
  bearing on the Roman scheme of coast defence in this part of Britain.
  The foundations were circular, 65 feet in diameter, and closely resembling
  in gigantic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[
  27]</a></span> form the steering-wheel of a ship. The foundations were
  of Kentish rag and chalk lime mortar, and above this the low walling
  was almost entirely composed of Roman bricks set in red mortar. Dr.
  Henry Laver, F.S.A., who communicated the discovery to the Society
  of Antiquaries of London,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> modestly
  abstains from giving any explanation or theory as to the purpose of
  the building which stood on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[
  28]</a></span> site, but in the opinion of the present writer there
  seems to be little doubt that the foundations were intended to carry
  a lofty pharos, or perhaps signalling tower of timber by means of which
  messages might have been transmitted to Othona and Colchester.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 4. RECULVER, KENT</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Now known as Reculver, is situated about three miles to the east of Herne
  Bay. The site, although originally some distance inland, is now, owing
  to the encroachment of the sea, quite close to the shore. Indeed, about
  half of its area has been destroyed by the waves, and is now covered
  at high water. Its area when complete was over seven acres, and its
  walls which, in the eighteenth century, stood 10 feet high, and still
  remain to a height of 8 feet in some places, are no less than 8 feet
  in thickness with two sets-off inside. It seems doubtful whether there
  was ever a ditch round the castrum. Owing to the ruinous condition
  of the main part of the masonry, and the<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[
  31]</a></span> complete destruction which has overtaken the northern
  part of the foundations, it is impossible to ascertain any particulars
  as to the gates or internal arrangements.</p>

<p class="space-above">As will be seen from the accompanying ground-plan the form of the castrum
  at Reculver was quadrangular. The angles were rounded, but there are
  no indications of towers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[
  32]</a></span> or bastions. These features are considered characteristic
  of Roman fortresses of early date. Another feature pointing to the
  same conclusion is the absence of tile courses in the walls.</p>
<p>The only recorded facts about this fortress is a mention in the &ldquo;Notitia,&rdquo; from
  which we learn that it was garrisoned by the first cohort of the Vetasians
  commanded by a tribune.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 6. RECULVER: THE RUINS OF THE CHURCH</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">At a comparatively early stage in the art of Roman masonry in Britain
  the idea was conceived of protecting the enclosing wall of the fortress
  by means of projecting bastions and towers. In an early type represented
  in the Romano-British coast fortresses, of which this of Reculver is
  an excellent illustration, there were, as we have seen, no projections
  whether of walls, bastions, towers, or gates. Reliance was placed in
  the strength and solidity of the walls themselves, which were 8 feet
  in thickness. But the desirability of having some points from which
  the enemy could be attacked in flank whilst battering the wall soon
  became evident, and in other cases such as Richborough,<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[
  35]</a></span> Lymne, Pevensey, etc., we find that the fortress was
  furnished not only with massive walls, but also with strong angle-towers
  and bastions or towers at intervals by which the wall could be commanded
  and protected.</p>
<p>These various works furnish an interesting series of illustrations of
  the progress made in the military architecture of the period.</p>

<h4>5. <span class="smcap">Rutupiae</span></h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 574px;"> <img src="images/i_049.jpg" alt="" height="600" width="574" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 7. RUTUPIAE (RICHBOROUGH)</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Now known as Richborough, situated about two miles north-north-west of
  Sandwich, was a station of great importance in the Roman period, being
  then, as Sandwich was subsequently for many years, the chief British
  port for travellers and traffic to and from the Continent. In shape
  Rutupiae was a rectangular parallelogram, with the greater length from
  east to west. Its walls, which were lofty and massive, enclosed an
  area of somewhat less than 6 acres. At each angle is, or was, a circular
  bastion 18 feet 6 inches in diameter, and square towers or bastions
  at intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[
  36]</a></span> projected beyond the general face of the walls. A considerable
  part of the south-east corner, and the whole of the east wall have
  been destroyed by the falling of the cliff in the direction of the
  River Stour. The theory formerly propounded that the castrum had no
  eastern wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[
  37]</a></span> has been disproved by the careful examinations of Mr.
  G. E. Fox and other eminent antiquaries. These examinations have definitely
  shown that large fragments of the east wall have fallen down the cliff.
  It is certain that the castrum of Rutupiae as also those of Regulbium
  and Portus Lemanis, in spite of the doubt which has been expressed
  in each instance, had four walls.</p>
<p>The chief peculiarity of Rutupiae is the presence of a solid mass of masonry
  underground, a little to the east rather than in the middle of the
  enclosed space. Many different theories have been put forward to account
  for its purpose, but it is now generally agreed that it was intended
  to serve as the foundation for a lofty structure, perhaps of timber,
  the purpose of which was for signalling between this station and that
  at Reculver, and possibly also answering to the pharos at Dover. It
  is not improbable that it also served as a lighthouse for ships entering
  the estuary of the Stour from the sea. If lights or signals could be
  seen as far as Dover they might from that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[
  38]</a></span> point be communicated easily to and fro from the coast
  of France from the high ground on which the pharos of Dover stands.</p>
<p>In order to understand the functions and relative positions of Regulbium
  and Rutupiae as coast fortresses during the Roman period, it is necessary
  to reconstruct the ancient geography of the north-eastern part of Kent.
  The small stream now falling into the sea near Reculver was at the
  period under consideration a river sufficiently broad and deep to afford
  a convenient channel for shipping. It was known as the Wantsum. Boats
  and ships voyaging from the French coast as well as from the British
  coast near Dover to London, usually took their course through the channel
  formed by the Stour and the Wantsum, thus avoiding the strong currents
  and tempestuous seas often raging off the North Foreland.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 8. RECULVER<br />
  From a print published in 1781</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">It will be seen, therefore, that a lofty tower or lighthouse at Rutupiae
  would have been of the greatest value both for the guidance of friendly
  shipping and as a means<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[
  41]</a></span> of giving warning of the approach of the enemy.</p>
<p>The north wall of the castrum at Richborough is a remarkably perfect and
  interesting specimen of Roman masonry. It is noteworthy, too, as furnishing
  proof of the great care and thoroughness with which the Romans carried
  out their building works. At the base of the wall, on the outside,
  one sees four courses of flint in their natural form, and above them
  the following succession of materials, in ascending order: three courses
  of dressed flint; two courses of bonding tile; seven courses of ashlar
  and two of tile; seven courses of ashlar and two of tile; seven courses
  of ashlar and two of tile; seven courses of ashlar and two of tile;
  eight courses of ashlar and two of tile; nine courses of ashlar. The
  wall is 23 feet 2 inches high, and 10 feet 8 inches thick.</p>
<p>There is one aspect of some of the Roman coast fortresses which shows
  that their builders were not influenced entirely by utilitarian ideas.
  This is the methodical and tasteful use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[
  42]</a></span> stones of different colours in such a way as to produce
  a pleasing species of colour decoration. The aim obviously was to break
  up the monotony of broad spaces of masonry, and possibly, also, to
  enhance their apparent size by multiplication of detail. The north
  wall of Richborough, although to some extent marred by rebuilding of
  some part of it, affords an illustration of this. Here we find dark
  brownish-red ironstone built into the wall in a way which reminds one
  of bands of chequer work. A Pevensey again, where the stones are cut
  with the regularity and precision of brickwork, large blocks of similar
  sandstone are employed in regular order at different heights in the
  walls and bastions. To the latter in addition to their decorative use
  they serve to tie in the outer skin of masonry to the inner rubble.</p>

<h4 class="space-above">6. <span class="smcap">Dubris, Dover</span></h4>

<p>A paper by Rev. Canon Puckle on Vestiges of Roman Dover was published
  some years ago in &ldquo;Archaeologia Cantiana.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> It
  was<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> accompanied
  by a plan in which are set out the outlines of what are supposed to
  have been the limits of the Roman town or fortress of Dover. Although
  the outline is merely tentative and hypothetical, there is a certain
  plausibility about the suggested site and size of the castrum. It was
  situated, as is pointed out, quite away from the pharos, in the lowest
  part of the town, the present Market Square being approximately in
  the middle of the enclosure. The plan is roughly a parallelogram with
  certain irregularities on the north-west angle.</p>
<p>On the top of the eastern and western heights of Dover a lighthouse was
  erected by the Romans for the guidance of ships into the narrow mouth
  of the river. Traces of that on the western heights still remain, or
  remained recently: whilst that on the eastern heights stands intact,
  one of the most remarkable and interesting pieces of Roman architecture
  now remaining in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The Roman pharos at Dover consists of a strong and massive tower, hollow
  within,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span> which
  rises to a height of 42 feet, having walls whose thickness varies from
  12 feet at the base to about 7 feet at the top. The structure is not
  entirely of Roman workmanship, because in the thirteenth century certain
  additions were made to its outer walls.</p>
<p>Doubtless its massive masonry was calculated to withstand the severe storms
  to which its exposed position on the lofty cliff subjected it. Whether
  employed for signalling purposes or as a lighthouse, this building
  was doubtless in such a position as to communicate with similar buildings
  on the coast of France, and with the lighthouse or signalling tower
  (it may have served in both capacities) at Richborough.</p>
<p>The pharos on the western heights of Dover, of which little now remains,
  must have formed an extremely valuable auxiliary to that on the eastern
  heights, affording a guide for ships making at night for the haven
  of Dover. It is not at all improbable that both structures combined
  the purposes of lighthouses at night with those of signalling stations
  in the daytime.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 10. PHAROS, DOVER</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The precise details of the existing pharos, although of the greatest interest
  from architectural and archaeological points of view, are not necessary
  to our present purpose, but a few facts are worthy of notice.</p>
<p>The masonry throughout is of tufa with the exception of two or three courses
  of Roman tiles at intervals of about 4 feet, and the foundations, which
  again consist of several courses of tiles arranged in three sets-off,
  and with an octagonal plan.</p>
<p>The tower is of octagonal plan externally, and square within, where each
  of the four walls measures about 14 feet. The structure is believed
  to have been repaired and cased with flint in the year 1259, when Richard
  de Codnore was Constable of Dover Castle. His arms, Barry of six, argent
  and azure, are carved in stone on the north side of the pharos. The
  octagonal chamber in the top story of the tower appears to have been
  restored or rebuilt in Tudor times.</p>
<p>It is interesting and instructive to compare the Dover lighthouses in
  their relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[
  50]</a></span> French coast and Richborough, with the signalling tower
  or lighthouse of West Mersea, by means of which communications were
  kept up with the sea-coast station and castrum of Othona.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the defensive character of the forts with which the lighthouses
  were associated, it seems probable that their purpose had a close relation
  to the work of watching the coast, and obtaining early information
  of the approach of invaders.</p>
<p>There is a strong probability that more of such buildings for observing
  the approach of enemies once existed, traces of which have now perished.</p>

<h4 class="space-above">7. <span class="smcap">Portus Lemanis</span></h4>

<p>Situated originally on the side of a spur of high ground at Lymne, near
  Hythe, and overlooking the flat ground of Romney Marsh, was a fortified
  station of sufficient importance to rank as a town. Its distance from
  Dover, and its situation on the south coast, suggest<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[
  53]</a></span> that it cannot have formed a part of the group of contemporary
  fortresses which defended the east coast of Kent.</p>

<p>Owing to a landslip on a large scale, which happened possibly before the
  Norman Conquest, the whole of the site upon which this town stood slipped
  downwards towards Romney Marsh, and the massive walls and towers by
  which it was once encompassed were disturbed, shattered, and overturned.</p>
<p>The form, as far as can be gathered from the disturbed foundations, was
  somewhat irregular. The east and west walls were parallel, and the
  south wall ran at right angles with them, but the north wall had an
  outward bow-like projection. The walls, when the place was intact,
  enclosed a space of about 11 acres, and were from 12 feet to 14 feet
  thick, whilst the height of both walls and mural towers was somewhat
  more than 20 feet.</p>
<p>The purpose of placing a strongly fortified town at this place was partly
  in order to command a view over the surrounding country, and partly
  to defend the Roman port which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[
  54]</a></span> was situated on a branch of the River Limene,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or
  rather, just at the foot of the hill on the side of which it stood.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 12. ROMAN WALLS, LYMNE, KENT</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Among the discoveries made at Portus Lemanis there were two of remarkable
  and significant character. The first consisted of a mutilated altar-stone,
  bearing a much-worn inscription indicating the dedication of the altar
  by a praefect of the British fleet, named Aufidius Pantera, probably
  to Neptune. The stone<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[
  57]</a></span> was found built into the masonry of the principal gate,
  and from its worn condition, and the remains of barnacles which it
  still bore when found, it was justly inferred that it belonged to an
  earlier period than that of the building of the gate. The second discovery,
  of quite equal interest with the first, was that of a number of broken
  roof and other tiles, inscribed <span class="smcap lowercase">CLBR</span>, which has been read <i>Classiarii
  Britannici</i>, Marines of the British fleet.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;"> <img src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="" height="600" width="361" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 13. PORTUS LEMANIS (LYMPNE)</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">From these discoveries one may gather that at some period, probably before
  that of Constantine, a division of the British fleet was situated at
  Portus Lemanis, and that some of the buildings there were erected by
  the crew from the fleet.</p>
<p>The principal gate, which may have been battered down during a siege,
  and required rebuilding, was evidently the work of a late date in the
  Roman period. This view is supported by a comparison of the whole building
  with the work at Anderida (Pevensey). The general arrangement of the
  walls, the disposition of the mural towers, or bastions, and the facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[
  58]</a></span> of regularly cut limestone blocks present points of
  very considerable similarity.</p>
<p>It will be observed from a comparison of Portus Lemanis with Anderida
  (about to be described) that there is reason to think that both works
  belong to a date somewhat late in the Roman period.</p>

<h4>8. <span class="smcap">Anderida (Pevensey)</span></h4>

<p>The castrum at Pevensey retains so much of its enclosing walls and bastions
  that it is particularly worthy of study if one would learn, by direct
  observation, what splendid specimens of architecture the Romans erected
  in this country. Although a mediaeval castle has been built within
  the boundary of the Roman castrum, the walls of the latter may be traced
  for almost the whole of the circuit, and on the north, east, and west
  sides they stand to a considerable height. At the south-western extremity
  is the main gateway, its two flanking towers forming perhaps the most
  prominent features. Proceeding to the north of this gate<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[
  61]</a></span> we find three good specimens of bastions of somewhat
  horse-shoe form on plan. A series of six similarly planned bastions
  remain at the opposite side of the fortress, the general plan of which
  may be said to be elliptical.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 14. BASTION ON SOUTH-WESTERN WALL, PEVENSEY</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The character of the facing masonry, especially on the south-west side,
  is quite remarkable. The facing consists of carefully squared blocks
  of limestone laid with the regularity and precision of brickwork.</p>
<p>Two characteristics stand out prominently in comparing this with other
  Roman castra on the coast of Britain. One is the irregularity of plan,
  the other is the presence of numerous projecting bastions. Both point
  to the lateness of the work, and some valuable evidence, confirming
  this view, has been brought to light in recent years. In 1907 Mr. Charles
  Dawson, F.S.A., communicated to the Society of Antiquaries<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> some
  notes on tiles found here bearing the stamp</p>
<p class="pn" style="text-align: center"> HON AUG<br />
  ANDRIA</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>The first line apparently refers to the Emperor Honorius (395-423), whilst
  the second may be regarded as indicating with somewhat less certainty
  the name Anderida.</p>

<h4>9. <span class="smcap">Portus Magnus (Porchester)</span></h4>

<p>This remarkably fine castrum, which stands on the edge of the most northern
  creek forming a part of Portsmouth Harbour, consists of a square enclosure
  containing a space of about 9 acres. Its walls, 10 feet in thickness,
  are constructed of flint rubble with courses of bonding-tiles. Originally
  each angle was furnished with a hollow bastion, or tower, and similar
  bastions, hollow within, were placed along the walls at intervals of
  from 100 feet to 200 feet. Some of these bastions have been destroyed,
  but fourteen examples, in a more or less perfect condition, remain.
  The water-gate, on the eastern side, still survives in a peculiarly
  perfect state. It is remarkable from the fact that the blocks of stone
  forming its semicircular arch are of light and dark colour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[
  63]</a></span> and are arranged alternately, so as to impart a picturesque
  and decorative effect.</p>

  PORCHESTER ROMAN CASTRUM</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The identification of Porchester with the Portus Magnus of the Romans
  has been questioned by Professor Haverfield, and there can be no doubt
  that it rests upon insufficient evidence. Conceivably it may be the
  Portus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> Adurni
  of the Romans: but this is not certain.</p>
<p>A Norman castle, with remarkably fine keep, still practically intact,
  was built in the north-west corner, and the parish church, also of
  Norman architecture, was constructed near the south-east angle, within
  the walls of the castrum.</p>
<p><i>Clausentum</i>, an important Roman station, now known as Bitterne,
  is situated a little to the north of Southampton, on the banks of the
  tidal estuary of the River Itchen. Practically nothing in the shape
  of architectural traces now remain, but from accounts written before
  their complete destruction we know that it was enclosed with walls
  9 feet thick, and constructed of flint bonded with large flat tiles
  and roughly faced with small square stones. It has been supposed that
  the outer defences when perfect measured 500 yards in length. The station
  was three-sided, the walls each having an outward curve. The outer
  defences are believed to have enclosed an area of 20 acres: the inner
  defences, 10 acres.</p>

<p class="space-above"><i>Cardiff.</i>&#8212;Although not situated near the Continent, it is
  probable that Cardiff took its part in the defence of our coast during
  the Roman period. Whether the Roman fortress at this point formed part
  of the defences which were placed under the control of the Count of
  the Saxon Shore may be doubted, but in size and general plan it certainly
  resembled the coast fortresses of the south-eastern shores.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 17. PORCHESTER. EXTERIOR OF WEST WALL</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">In the course of recent excavations in and near Cardiff Castle the nearly
  complete ground-plan of this castrum was found. Its form was nearly
  quadrangular, the only irregularity being in the western wall, which
  was inclined eastward at its southern end. Gates were situated about
  the middle of the northern and southern walls, whilst semicircular
  bastions were placed along the walls at intervals, roughly, of about
  120 feet. At the angles were built towers of irregular form and of
  somewhat unusual interest, from the fact that they were obviously additions
  to the original work. The area enclosed by the walls was roughly a
  square of 600 feet.</p>
<p>The question of angle towers or bastions is one of considerable importance.
  Their presence in a Roman castrum may generally be taken as evidence
  of late date; but it is necessary to bear in mind that in some cases
  they have certainly been added to give strength to fortresses of early
  type, which, as we have seen in the cases of Reculver and Brancaster,
  were furnished with rounded angles, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[
  69]</a></span> any such projecting features as angle-towers or bastions.
  At Cardiff<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> it
  is perfectly clear that the original building had rounded angles against
  which towers of irregularly circular plan were subsequently built.</p>
<p>As at Pevensey and Porchester, a Norman castle was ingeniously constructed
  within this castrum by placing the mound towards the north-western
  corner. Two walls thrown out from this, one towards the western wall
  and the other to about the middle of the southern wall, enclosed practically
  a quarter of the whole area in the south-western angle, and formed
  the inner court, whilst the whole of the rest of the area of the castrum
  formed the outer court. It is obvious that at the period when this
  Norman castle was built the Roman walls were sufficiently perfect to
  afford an effective barrier of defence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Other Roman Coast Defences</span></h4>

<p>The coast to the north of Brancaster, the most northern of the nine regular
  Roman coast castra, is provided in certain places with defences of
  Roman date, either in the form of watch-houses, or lighthouses, or
  fortresses.</p>
<p>Professor Haverfield, in a recent lecture on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> suggests
  that such structures once existed at (1) Huntcliffe (near Saltburn);
  (2) at a point near Staithes; (3) on the high promontory of Peak, near
  Robin Hood Bay; and (4) on another high headland, called Carrnase,
  to the north of Filey Bay. Generally speaking, the altitude of the
  sites of these works suggests their use for watching or lighting purposes
  rather than for purely military defence.</p>
<p>To a certain extent the Roman walled towns of Canterbury, Rochester, Chichester,
  Colchester, and London, must be regarded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[
  71]</a></span> having exercised a share in the coast defence of England,
  because they were situated on rivers now or formerly navigable, and
  not too far from the sea-coast to be absolutely without value in repelling
  invaders.</p>
<p>The fact that they were constructed specially for defensive purposes,
  not only against near neighbours, but also against those unwelcome
  visitors who, from the remote past, and all through the middle ages,
  have been attracted by the wealth of England, brings them within the
  scope of the present essay. For obvious reasons, however, and mainly
  because of the question of space, it is unnecessary to describe in
  detail every defensive work which was partially available for English
  coast defence.</p>

<h3 class="mf"><a name="THE_SAXON_SETTLEMENT_OF" id="THE_SAXON_SETTLEMENT_OF">THE SAXON
  SETTLEMENT OF ENGLAND</a></h3>

<p>With the settlement of the Saxons, the Angles, and the Jutes in England,
  this book has no immediate concern, but it is worthy of note that having
  driven the British people westward into Wales and south-westward into
  Cornwall, they quickly spread over the greater part of England. Their
  weapons, their costumes, their jewellery, and, indeed, their general
  standard of civilization, are clearly reflected and illustrated by
  the contents of numerous cemeteries, which have been scientifically
  explored and examined. We know little of their houses or other buildings
  until the eleventh century, when we are aided by the actual remains
  of churches, the evidence of illuminated manuscripts and the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, however, one fact which stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[
  76]</a></span> out quite clearly in an age which is remarkable
  for the obscurity of its historical evidence. This is that
  the Saxons, as a general rule, did not immediately occupy
  the ruins of Romano-British towns or houses. On the contrary,
  they seem to have avoided them, even to the extent of diverting
  the roads which originally passed through the towns. This
  is so marked that we can only infer that it was due to
  a superstitious dread of sites which had once been inhabited
  by the Romans. The site of the important Romano-British
  town of Silchester, although full of evidences of Roman
  occupation, and of intercourse with contemporary British
  population, has furnished absolutely no trace of Saxon
  habitation.</p>
<p>What was true of cities and towns and houses, was probably true of the
  coast fortresses upon which the Romans, particularly in the latter
  part of their occupation of Britain, had expended so much time and
  labour.</p>
<p>It is extremely doubtful whether the Saxons ever garrisoned the coast fortresses
  abandoned when the Roman legions were withdrawn from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[
  77]</a></span> Britain. Numismatic evidence shows that there was an
  Anglo-Saxon mint at Lymne, the Portus Lemanus of the Romans, and possessing
  an important harbour. The coins minted there range from King Edgar&rsquo;s
  time to that of Edward the Confessor, but there is reason to believe
  that the Roman site was deserted at an early period in the Saxon occupation,
  the neighbouring town of Hythe taking its place. Certain Saxon coins
  bearing the legend RIC, have been attributed to a mint at Richborough,
  but there is a good deal of doubt as to this identification. Coins
  of middle and late Saxon kings, as we might have expected, were minted
  at Canterbury, Rochester, Sandwich, and Dover, but generally speaking
  the evidence of Saxon coinage does not support the view that the purely
  coast fortresses of the Romans were ever used to any great extent by
  the Saxons.</p>
<p>The Saxons built burhs, or towns fortified with earthen ramparts, probably
  palisaded, in many parts of the kingdom, and the evidence for them
  will be found in the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&rdquo; but they were
  not castle-builders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[
  78]</a></span> They were a people with tribal instincts and traditions.
  They did not construct defensive dwellings for a single lord and his
  family and retainers; they expended their efforts rather on fortified
  towns for the protection of all their people.</p>
<p>Wareham, in Dorset, is generally believed to be an example of the fortified
  towns of the Anglo-Saxons. Sandwich, again, which retains considerable
  traces of mediaeval earthern ramparts, and was a port of great consequence
  in early times, was also probably fortified by the Anglo-Saxons. It
  is impossible to say whether any part of its earthwork defences are
  of that early period. Dover, Canterbury, Rochester, Chichester, Colchester,
  and some other walled towns of Roman origin, appear, from archaeological
  evidence, to have had Anglo-Saxon populations, possibly of late date,
  when the Roman houses had disappeared and the dread of the Romans had
  become forgotten. It may be doubted whether the Saxons took advantage
  of the Roman walled defences.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>As we have already pointed out, there are very few remains of purely defensive
  works belonging to the Anglo-Saxon period. For this reason the quadrangular
  moated site at Bayford, near Sittingbourne, in Kent, is of peculiar
  interest, because as Mr. Harold Sands, F.S.A.,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> has
  pointed out, the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&rdquo; mentions that King
  Alfred here threw up a &ldquo;geweorc&rdquo; in 893 in order to repel
  the inroads of the Danes under Bjorn-laernside, who had formed an encampment
  at a place called Milton, in Kemsley Downs on the opposite side of
  Milton Creek, a mile and a half north of Bayford Castle.</p>
<p>The incursions of the Danes and other raiders provided the Saxons with
  excellent opportunities for displaying their skill in defensive warfare,
  and brought into prominence a great man whose name must ever be held
  in honour as one of the bravest and most enlightened defenders of our
  shores. To King Alfred, commonly known in recent years as Alfred the
  Great, belongs the credit of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[
  80]</a></span> conceived the idea of destroying the enemy&rsquo;s power at
  sea in order to secure the safety of our shores. He seems to have been
  the first man in our history to have grasped this great principle.
  He led this navy to action in person and so acquired the epithet of &ldquo;the
  first English admiral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early in his reign, King Alfred devoted his attention to the important
  question of his navy, and he brought it to such a condition of strength
  and proficiency as to defeat the Danish raiders, one of the greatest
  pests by which our shores were ever troubled.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="mf"><a name="DANISH_INCURSIONS_AND_CAMPS" id="DANISH_INCURSIONS_AND_CAMPS">DANISH
  INCURSIONS AND CAMPS</a></h3>

<p>The coast-line of England is of curious complexity, and is long out of
  all proportion to that of any other great European nation, perhaps
  not even excepting Norway. Consequently its defence presents and always
  has presented problems of great difficulty. Much of the coast-line
  is rocky and dangerous even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[
  81]</a></span> for friendly shipping. In other places, where cliffs
  are absent, shoals and sand-banks make navigation and landing difficult
  and dangerous. In looking back to the days when there were no artificial
  harbours and landing-places, one sees quite clearly that estuaries
  of rivers would have afforded the safest and most convenient places
  for landing. That such spots were selected is abundantly proved by
  tradition, history, and actual contemporary remains.</p>
<p>The Danes were quick to seize upon such favourable landing-places. They
  were provided with boats of great length and slight draught, and their
  operations were not limited, therefore, to the deeper rivers. During
  the latter years of the eighth century, and practically throughout
  the tenth, the Danish raids on Britain were numerous. In due course
  they established themselves on river-banks, and built permanent camps.
  According to the
  &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,&rdquo; Hasting constructed and occupied
  a camp at Shoebury for a short period in the year 894. The camp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[
  82]</a></span> or such part of it as now exists, has been described
  by Mr. Spurrell<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> as
  a Danish work. The place has been much destroyed by the inroads of
  the sea and the building of various military works, such as barracks,
  etc., but the plan can be made out, and as restored by Mr. Spurrell,
  may be described as an irregular quadrangle with rounded corners, and
  containing an area of about one third part of a square mile.</p>
<p>Another Danish camp was constructed the same year at Appledore, the Danes
  sailing or rowing up the river Rother. According to Somner<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> they
  discovered at Appledore a half-built fortress, but finding it insufficient
  for their needs they built a larger entrenchment on the same site.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 18. PLAN OF DANISH CAMP, SHOEBURY, ESSEX</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Other places where the Danes settled were Benfleet, probably Swanscombe
  (although the existing remains of the camp belong probably to the Norman
  period); Bramber, Sussex; an earthwork surrounding East Mersea Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[
  83]</a></span> Essex; and many other places. Here they constructed
  their camps and established their forces for long periods, using the
  adjacent rivers as channels for quickly putting to sea in their swiftly-moving
  boats when embarking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[
  84]</a></span> on raiding excursions to the neighbouring coasts.</p>
<p>They raided Sheppey in 832, Kent, Canterbury and London in 851. In 876
  they took Wareham, where are interesting earthen town-walls, perhaps
  of Saxon origin. During one or more of their raids in the Medway they
  penetrated as far as Rochester, which they pillaged. Sandwich and Canterbury
  suffered much from their visits in the eleventh century.</p>
<p>It may be noted that the favourite methods of the Danes when invading
  England was to enter the rivers so as to reach by that means populous
  towns and districts where they could seize valuable possessions. The
  monastic houses were their favourite prey, and few in England escaped
  injury or pillage at their hands.</p>
<p>The following extract from the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&rdquo; gives
  a vivid picture of the doings of the Danes at the end of the tenth
  century:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 999. In this year the army
    again came about into the Thames, and then went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[
    85]</a></span> up along the Medway, and to Rochester. And then
    the Kentish force came against them, and they stoutly engaged
    together, but alas! that they too quickly gave way and fled;
    because they had not the support which they should have had.
    And the Danish had possession of the place of carnage; and then
    took horses and rode whithersoever they themselves would, and
    ruined and plundered almost all the West Kentish. Then the king
    with his &lsquo;witan&rsquo; resolved that they should be opposed with a
    naval force, and also with a land force. But when the ships were
    ready, then they delayed from day to day, and harassed the poor
    people who lay in the ships; and ever as it should be forwarder,
    so was it later, from one time to another: and ever they let
    their foes&rsquo; army increase, and ever they receded from the sea,
    and ever they went forth after them. And then in the end neither
    the naval force nor the land force was productive of anything
    but the people&rsquo;s distress, and a waste of money, and the emboldening
    of their foes.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="mf"><a name="THE_NORMAN_INVASION_OF" id="THE_NORMAN_INVASION_OF">THE NORMAN
  INVASION OF ENGLAND</a></h3>

<p>It is a remarkable fact that the greatest event in the whole history of
  foreign attack upon England, namely, the invasion under the leadership
  of William, Duke of Normandy, in 1066, excited less interest, and provoked
  less effective opposition than many other incidents of infinitely minor
  importance.</p>
<p>The invasion was not unexpected by any means. When tidings of the projected
  invasion reached England, the largest fleet and army ever seen in this
  country were being mobilized at Sandwich. Yet, when the Norman invaders
  actually arrived the English made practically no opposition at all.
  It appears that the crews of the navy were tired of being under arms
  so long, and went home; whilst the king was bound to go northward to
  put down the troubles in Yorkshire. Nothing was ready.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<p>The Norman fleet consisted, according to various accounts, of from 696
  to 1,000 vessels. It can hardly be described as a navy, because the
  ships were too small to carry much more than the men and their arms:
  there was no room for provisions, and when on the 28 September 1066,
  the invaders landed in Pevensey Bay they encountered no opposition.
  In the Battle of Hastings the English forces were protected within
  palisaded entrenchments, but the result of the conflict was a decisive
  defeat.</p>
<p>The Normans having secured a foot-hold in the country, commenced at once
  to make their tenure secure, and to establish their power. This they
  accomplished with wonderful skill and success.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="mf"><a name="NORMAN_COAST_CASTLES" id="NORMAN_COAST_CASTLES">NORMAN COAST
  CASTLES</a></h3>

<p>The castles first built in England by the Normans consisted of palisaded
  earthworks, the main feature being a lofty but truncated mound encircled
  by a deep ditch, and closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[
  88]</a></span> related to it were generally two courts or baileys.
  They were built in such situations as would command rivers and important
  roads, and so dominate the English people. Usually the castles of this
  period were built just within the boundaries of walled towns. The relation
  of the Tower to the City of London affords an excellent example of
  this arrangement.</p>
<p>Primarily the purpose of the Norman castle was to complete the work begun
  at the Battle of Hastings of subjugating the native population of England,
  and it is believed that castles of this type were employed for this
  purpose, because of the ease and rapidity with which they could be
  thrown up. Castles of this type were erected in England, not only after
  the Norman Conquest but also before it, and at one time the idea was
  generally held that they represented the usual and normal species of
  defence employed in Saxon times. The late G. T. Clark, who was a pioneer
  in the scientific study of English and Welsh castles, considered that
  these works were the actual burhs of the Anglo-Saxons, so often mentioned
  in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span> the &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon
  Chronicle.&rdquo; The theory was generally accepted for some years,
  but in due course doubts were cast upon it by the researches of Dr.
  J. Horace Round, Mrs. E. S. Armitage and others. It is now generally
  held that those examples of this type of defence which are known to
  have been constructed before the Conquest were built under the influence
  of Edward the Confessor&rsquo;s Norman friends. England at that time was
  following the fashions of Normandy; but the great majority of defences
  of this type were built, probably, very soon after the Norman Conquest,
  and under the direct influence of the Norman Conquerors. It is worthy
  of note that numerous examples exist to this day in Normandy, and some,
  with the characteristic palisaded mound, are represented in the Bayeux
  tapestry.</p>
<p>In many cases the earthwork castles as first built were, in due course,
  rebuilt in stone, the top of the mound being capped by a shell-keep
  and the other eminences being surmounted and reinforced by walls. Another
  type of keep,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[
  90]</a></span> generally square in plan and of great strength and size,
  was built, as at Dover, Rochester, Canterbury, London, etc.; but such
  massive structures required firm foundations, and they were always
  built on undisturbed sites. These two kinds of keeps practically determine
  the two types into which the Norman castles built in England naturally
  fall.</p>
<p>A fairly large proportion of those Norman castles which may be considered
  to have been built for coast defence, have been constructed in such
  a way as to take advantage of pre-existing Roman castra. Porchester
  is an admirable specimen. Here the north-western portion of the Roman
  enclosure has been cut off by Norman walls so as to form the inner
  bailey, whilst the remainder has been converted into the outer bailey.
  Pevensey, London, Rochester, Colchester, Cardiff and Lancaster are
  other excellent examples.</p>
<p>In passing, it may be noted, that at Reculver and Porchester, the parish
  church has been built, doubtless for safety, within the walls of the
  castrum; whilst at Pevensey two parish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[
  91]</a></span> churches have been erected sufficiently near the castrum
  to suggest that the sites were selected with a view to securing protection.</p>
<p>The regular castles of masonry erected during the reign of Henry II, a
  great castle-building period, although very important as military works,
  were not in the main built for the defence of the coast. But it is
  necessary to bear in mind that in ancient times river-courses, even
  far from the sea-coast, were subject in a peculiar degree to the incursions
  of the enemy, and the great Norman keeps of Canterbury, Rochester,
  and the White Tower of London, although situated far from the sea-coast,
  played an important part in the defence of the coast. At Porchester,
  Pevensey, Hastings, Folkestone and Dover, the relation between the
  Norman castles and the coast defences was much more intimate.</p>

  CASTLES AND WALLED TOWNS ON THE COAST</a></h3>

<p>In the following account of the more important of the castles which in
  mediaeval times guarded the coast, it has been found convenient to
  include a notice of those walled towns with which, in many cases, they
  were closely associated. The mediaeval castle, generally speaking,
  represents an effort to maintain the power of the feudal lord, and,
  in a lesser and secondary degree, provision for resisting raids and
  invasion by foreign enemies. Walled towns, on the other hand, when
  situated on or near the coasts, or on navigable rivers, were primarily
  designed for coast defence. The mediaeval castles which were built
  in situations remote from the coast were the fastnesses and strongholds
  of nobles fighting amongst themselves or against the king.</p>
<p>In the following accounts of the more important examples of castles and
  walled towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[
  96]</a></span> wholly or partially designed for the defence of the
  coast, occasion will be taken to point out the interesting series of
  developments through which these mediaeval fortifications passed as
  time went on. For example:</p>
<p>The massive keep of the Norman castles was able to resist fire and battering-ram
  when the besieging force came near enough to apply them. Its strength
  consisted in its thick walls, its height, and its massive masonry.
  The Edwardian castle, on the other hand, presents certain structural
  improvements which mark a great advance in military construction. The
  walls, gates, and towers are so built as to present curved surfaces
  to the engines of the enemy, with the result that missiles hurled against
  them would glance off at various angles according to the direction
  of the curve at the point of impact. The extent to which this development
  of the curve is carried in the walls of many of the Edwardian castles
  is quite remarkable and instructive. It shows that mere weight and
  bulk were no longer relied upon, but constructive skill and the judicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[
  97]</a></span> use of materials were guiding principles in the military
  architecture of the period.</p>
<p>The following list does not include the sixteenth century blockhouses
  and other fortifications erected by Henry VIII, and in subsequent years.</p>
<p>The defences on the eastern coast of England consist of an extremely interesting
  and important series of fortresses. In the extreme north is&#8212;</p>
<p><i>Berwick-upon-Tweed</i>, a town which, from its position on the English
  and Scottish border, has always been a place of strategic moment, and
  which Queen Elizabeth spoke of as &ldquo;the chief key of the realm.&rdquo; In
  the time of Edward I (1272-1307) it was encompassed by a great moat,
  or ditch, 80 feet wide and 40 feet deep. A crenelated wall from 15
  to 22 feet high, with 19 towers at intervals, was constructed during
  the reign of Edward II (1307-1327). A castle had been erected at Berwick
  during the reign of Henry II, and together with the Edwardian wall
  and ditch must have formed an extremely formidable defence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>
<p>The mediaeval fortifications included a large area, and in the time of
  Elizabeth a portion within this area was enclosed and strengthened
  by works of more modern character, the main features of which comprised
  five examples of the orillon type of bastion. The orillon was an enclosure
  of flattened triangular form, projecting beyond the curtain. The middle
  angle was obtuse, and the passage from the opening in the curtain into
  the bastion was somewhat restricted. It is obvious that such a bastion
  as this, which was introduced into England in the latter half of the
  sixteenth century, would give the maximum range for defensive fire,
  whilst affording most valuable means of protecting the flanks.</p>
<p>The fortifications of Berwick-upon-Tweed were primarily intended for defence
  against the Scottish Border raiders and incursions coming overland,
  but they also served to protect the town against the enemy approaching
  by sea.</p>
<p><i>Bamborough.</i>&#8212;The site of this castle must have been a place
  of great natural strength, and probably a fortress, from prehistoric
  times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> downwards.
  It would not be inaccurate to describe it as one of the important and
  historic spots in the kingdom. The castle dates from a period before
  the Norman Conquest. Here the Danish raiders were successfully repelled
  in 912. The castle was maintained in a good state of defence under
  Henry I, and the keep is of the twelfth century. Structural repairs
  were made at frequent intervals, viz., in 1183, 1197, 1198, 1201, and
  1202. A new gate-house was built here in consequence of the invasions
  of the Scots in 1383-4.</p>
<p>On several occasions Bamborough Castle has served as a prison, and it
  was brought into considerable prominence during the Wars of the Roses.
  The part it played in the various wars between England and Scotland
  must have been important.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
<p><i>Dunstanburgh.</i>&#8212;Situated on a bold, rugged headland, this fine
  castle reminds one of such great fortresses on the east coast as Scarborough
  and Tynemouth. Its share in the Border troubles was perhaps less than
  that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> Bamborough.
  Dunstanburgh is the largest castle in Northumberland, is built on a
  remarkable plan, and comprises an area of ten acres, the main part
  of which was occupied by the outer bailey. Its history is associated
  with Simon de Montfort and Thomas of Lancaster.</p>
<p>The castle was mainly erected in 1313-14. The great gate-house of the
  latter part of the fourteenth century, was planned and built on a colossal
  scale, and still forms a striking object, even in its ruin. By the
  sixteenth century the place had fallen into ruin.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p><i>Warkworth.</i>&#8212;This castle, remarkable for its eccentric plan,
  was built about the middle of the twelfth century.</p>
<p><i>Tynemouth.</i>&#8212;The priory and castle of Tynemouth (for it was
  a combination of both) occupied a prominent position among the mediaeval
  coast defences of England. The office of Prior of Tynemouth was one
  of great importance. The person who held it was possessed of vast spiritual
  and worldly influence. He maintained his own armed force, just as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[
  101]</a></span> Bishop of Durham did, and the gate-house<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of
  the priory was in reality a military fortress, a building of great
  solidity and strength. It was approached by a barbican, the passage-way
  being vaulted and furnished with a gate at each end.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>
<p><i>Scarborough.</i>&#8212;This place was defended by walls or earthworks
  and a fosse before the time of Henry III. Its castle was built as early
  as the time of Stephen, and rebuilt or enlarged in the reign of Henry
  II. During the Civil War Scarborough Castle was besieged. It was surrendered
  in 1645, and has long been in ruins. It enclosed nineteen acres of
  land and occupied a romantic site 300 feet above sea-level.</p>
<p><i>Hull.</i>&#8212;From an early period this seaport has been defended
  by fortifications. In the seventeenth century these comprised a moat
  and a complete system of walls, fortified gates, and drawbridges. It
  possessed five gates,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[
  102]</a></span> called Hessle Gate, Myton Gate, Beverley Gate, Low
  Gate, and North Gate, and two sally-ports. The whole fortified walls
  were 2,610 yards, or slightly less than one-and-a-half miles in circuit.
  In front of the principal gates were drawbridges and half-moon shaped
  batteries. In the year 1540 the eastern side of the town was defended
  by two blockhouses, erected by Henry VIII. These were known as the
  North Blockhouse and the South Blockhouse, and both mounted guns when
  the town was besieged during the Civil War. A castle was also built
  on the eastern side of the town by Henry VIII.</p>
<p><i>King&rsquo;s Lynn.</i>&#8212;The eastern side of this important town was
  in former times defended by a wall strengthened by nine bastions, and
  by a broad and deep fosse over which were three drawbridges leading
  to the principal gates. One of the latter and fragments of the wall
  remain. From the statement of Stow in his
  &ldquo;Chronicle,&rdquo; and from certain illustrations of the walls
  as they existed in 1800, we may infer that the walls at any rate belonged
  to the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[
  103]</a></span> half of the thirteenth century. The East Gate and the
  West Gate were rebuilt on the sites of earlier gates in the fifteenth
  century.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 19. NORTH GATE, YARMOUTH, 1807</span> </div>

<p class="space-above"><i>Yarmouth.</i>&#8212;The town-wall, of which some traces remain, measured
  between six and seven thousand feet in compass, and possessed ten gates
  and sixteen towers. Swinden,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> the
  historian of Yarmouth, states that the building of the wall</p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p class="pn">&ldquo;was begun on the east side, and very probably at the north-east
    tower in St. Nicholas&rsquo;s churchyard, and so proceeded southward:
    for in the 11th of Edward III we find them at work at the Black
    Friars, at the south end of the town; and afterwards we trace
    them to the north end, which, I presume, was the last part that
    was finished.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there is a tradition, that the north gate was built by
    the person or persons who had amassed considerable sums of money
    by being employed in burying the dead in the time of the plague.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As soon as the walls were finished, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[
    104]</a></span> was made a moat or ditch round the
    town, with bridges at each gate: the whole so complete
    that boats could pass with their lading to any part
    of the town, for the conveniency of trade and commerce.
    And so careful were the magistrates to preserve the
    said moat from being filled or stopped with earth,
    rubbish, stones, etc., that in the rolls of the leets,
    there appear several fines, levied on different persons
    for offending in that behalf. Thus the tower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[
    105]</a></span> being fortified with a wall and moat,
    towers, gates, and bars, was deemed a sufficient
    defence against all assailants with bows and arrows,
    slings, battering-rams, and all other missive engines
    of those times. But afterwards, when great guns of
    various denominations were employed in sieges, the
    aforesaid fortification, it was adjudged, would make
    but little resistance against them, without several
    additional works, as mounts, ravelins, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 20. SOUTH GATE, YARMOUTH, 1807</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">In the 36th year of Henry VIII the fortifications of Yarmouth were strengthened
  by rampiring, or backing up the walls by earthwork mounds. Additional
  works were constructed by Queen Mary in 1557, and by Queen Elizabeth,
  the complete process of rampiring not having been finished until 1587,
  the year before the coming of the Spanish armada. In the following
  year it was considered desirable to secure the haven against any sudden
  attacks of the enemy, and it was accordingly decided to construct jetties
  of timber on either side of the entrance, whilst across the actual
  entrance was placed a boom of massive timbers furnished with iron spikes,
  and this was so constructed that it could be opened or closed at pleasure.
  This work, including probably the two jetties and the boom, cost £120.</p>
<p>Traces of the wall of Yarmouth and its towers still remain, whilst other
  evidence of the wall is the extraordinary way in which the houses are
  crowded together, leaving only narrow alleys, or &ldquo;rows,&rdquo; for
  the traffic. A plan of Yarmouth in 1819, published as a frontispiece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[
  107]</a></span> to John Preston&rsquo;s &ldquo;Picture of Yarmouth,&rdquo;
  shows in an admirable way the congested state of the buildings within
  the walls.</p>

<p class="space-above"><i>Ipswich.</i>&#8212;There is a tradition that Ipswich was defended by
  a wall and fortified gates soon after the time of the Norman Conquest,
  but unfortunately no traces of either remain. Westgate Street preserves
  the memory of the picturesque West Gate. The interesting old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[
  108]</a></span> engraving shows St. Matthew&rsquo;s Gate, now demolished.
  There appears to have been a castle at Ipswich built by William the
  Conqueror, and Roger Bigot, one of the Conqueror&rsquo;s powerful nobles,
  held it. With the exception of certain earthworks all traces of the
  castle have perished. The form of the town in mediaeval times has been
  made out by John Wodderspoon in his &ldquo;Memorials of Ipswich,&rdquo; 1850.</p>
<p><i>Orford.</i>&#8212;This castle, situated half a mile from the River
  Ore, in Suffolk (hence its name), commands a view of the sea, two miles
  distant, owing to the fact that it is built on a mound partly natural
  and partly artificial. All round is swampy ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 405px;"> <img src="images/i_122.jpg" alt="" height="600" width="405" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 22. ORFORD CASTLE, SUFFOLK, 1810</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The building of Orford Castle was begun in 1166. Strictly speaking, perhaps,
  it should not be called a castle: it was essentially a keep, and its
  purpose primarily was to serve as an outpost for observation and for
  the protection of the coast. The plan of the actual keep, if so we
  may term it, was peculiar, being circular within, and so much modified
  by the buttresses<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> without as to
  present the appearance of a large number of angles.</p>
<p><i>Harwich.</i>&#8212;This ancient seaport situated on the extreme north-eastern
  point of Essex has always been a place of some strategic importance.
  It formerly was encompassed by a wall which had four gates and three
  posterns. In addition Harwich once possessed a small castle and other
  fortifications, but owing to the inroads of the sea these have for
  many years been submerged. Traces of the walls or foundations of the
  castle were seen, however, in 1784, when an unusually low tide laid
  bare more than usual of the sea-bottom.</p>
<p>On the south side of the town are some ancient earthworks locally ascribed
  to the Romans, although upon slender evidence.</p>
<p><i>Colchester</i>, which is situated on the river Colne, and perhaps not
  too far from the shore to take some part in the defence of the coast,
  has been in its time a place of great importance and of formidable
  strength. Its walls, of which considerable parts remain, are of Roman
  workmanship, and its castle, built largely of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[
  112]</a></span> materials, and therefore by some regarded as Roman
  in date, is almost unquestionably of Norman construction. It must be
  admitted, however, that the castle presents several features which
  differentiate it from the normal castles of the Norman period. Originally
  the walls were furnished with four principal gates, viz.: Head Gate,
  North Gate, East Gate, and St. Botolph&rsquo;s or South Gate, and three posterns,
  viz.: West Postern in St. Mary&rsquo;s Street, Schere Gate or South Postern,
  and Rye Gate or River Postern, but these have been demolished. The
  north and west sides of the town were defended by strong earthworks.
  The place was besieged for eleven weeks during the Civil War. It was
  held by the Royalist party, and on its fall, two of its most gallant
  defenders, Sir Charles Lucas and Sir George Lisle, were shot under
  the castle walls.</p>
<p>The weakness of mediaeval castles, built merely for passive resistance,
  has frequently been noticed, and what is true of them is equally true
  of the mediaeval walled town. Forces shut up within walls are obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[
  113]</a></span> unable to prevent an enemy from over-running a country.
  It must be borne in mind, however, that the purpose of fortifications
  behind walls was not, and never has been, merely intended to oppose
  the ravages of the enemy. In that part of our military history which
  is subsequent to the use of gunpowder, the uses of walled defence has
  been varied and manifold. For example: they were intended to check
  the enemy&rsquo;s advance; to give time for mobilization; to protect the
  strategical disposition of the army, especially in the early stages
  of a campaign; to protect important junctions in the lines of communications;
  and to safeguard magazines and stores against sudden and surprise attack
  of the enemy.</p>
<p><i>Cowling.</i>&#8212;The castle at Cowling or Cooling, situated about
  seven miles to the east of Gravesend, and just two from the sea-shore,
  was built between 1380 and 1385 by John de Cobham. The gate-house,
  built in the regular form in vogue during the latter end of the fourteenth
  century, and comparable with that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[
  114]</a></span> at Saltwood Castle and the West Gate of Canterbury,
  still remains in good preservation, as well as a good deal of the walls
  and angle-towers enclosing the inner ward, and certain parts of the
  walling enclosing the outer ward. The gate-house just referred to is
  on the south side of the outer ward, to which it gives access.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_127.jpg" alt="" height="410" width="600" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 23. COWLING CASTLE, KENT, 1784</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Perhaps one of the most interesting things about Cowling Castle is the
  fact that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[
  115]</a></span> built expressly for the defence of the coast against
  the French and the Spanish. This fact is rather pointedly referred
  to in the following contemporary inscription enamelled on copper plates
  attached to the eastern side of the gate-house:</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
 <span class="i0">Knouweyth that beth and schul be<br /></span>
 <span class="i0">That i am mad in help of the cuntre<br /></span>
 <span class="i0">In knowyng of whych thyng<br /></span>
 <span class="i0">This is chartre and wytnessyng.</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The inscription is set out in the form of a regular charter, to which
  is attached a seal bearing the Cobham arms, gules, on a chevron or,
  three lions rampant sable.</p>
<p>The situation of Cowling Castle on low-lying ground near the coast is
  a circumstance which confirms the idea that the fortress was built
  for coast defence purposes. On the other hand, however, inscriptions
  of this kind are of great rarity, and it has been suggested with great
  show of reason, that whilst the purpose was partly for the defence
  of the coast and partly to keep the people of Kent in order in what
  were peculiarly troubled times, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[
  116]</a></span> inscription was so worded as to divert attention from
  the latter. The suggestion is worthy of consideration, but the fact
  remains that towards the end of the fourteenth century this part of
  Kent was overrun by Frenchmen and Spaniards, who burned and destroyed
  all the houses they came across, and Cobham&rsquo;s intention in building
  Cowling Castle was to check these incursions.</p>
<p><i>Rochester.</i>&#8212;It is clear that Rochester has in its time been
  an important part of our coast defences. It still retains many fragments
  of its Roman wall, whilst its Norman castle is represented mainly by
  a stately keep 70 feet square in plan, and 113 feet in height, which
  forms an impressive object, and is in fact a remarkably fine example
  of castle-building. The Norman keep was built between the years 1126
  and 1139. The city wall, which was built in places on the site of the
  Roman wall, dates from the year 1225.</p>
<p><i>Queenborough.</i>&#8212;There is a tradition, possibly it is little
  more, that a residence of the Anglo-Saxon kings of Kent was situated
  here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> near
  the north-western mouth of the Swale, the building being afterwards
  known as the castle of Sheppey, in which island it is situated. The
  whole fortress was rebuilt by Edward III about the year 1361 according
  to plans made by William of Wykeham. Edward III in due course visited
  the place and gave it the name of Queenborough in honour of his queen
  Philippa.</p>
<p>As a coast defence a fortress on this site must have been of great value,
  commanding as it did the north-western mouth of the Swale, and protecting
  the water which divides the Isle of Sheppey from the mainland.</p>
<p>Henry VIII recognized the value of this point, and repaired it so as to
  make it suitable for use as one of his coast castles.</p>
<p>The plan of the mediaeval fortress, as might be expected when one remembers
  who designed it, is ingenious and remarkable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_131.jpg" alt="" height="587" width="600" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 24. PLAN OF QUEENBOROUGH CASTLE, KENT</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The main interest of this castle consists in its plan, which proves it
  to have been perhaps the earliest example of a fort as distinct from
  a typical castle of the middle ages, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[
  118]</a></span> there was always a certain amount of accommodation
  for dwelling-house purposes. Queenborough Castle contained, mainly
  in its six lofty circular towers, more than fifty rooms, but these
  were of small size. The building of the castle was commenced in 1361
  and finished about the year 1367. The plan was curiously symmetrical,
  and not unlike that of Camber Castle, built in the time of Henry VIII,
  but the elevations of the two fortresses display<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[
  119]</a></span> great differences. The lofty towers of Queenborough,
  serviceable enough in the fourteenth century when artillery attacks
  offered no serious menace, are wanting in Camber Castle, built in the
  sixteenth century, and their place is taken by low squat towers which
  offered little surface for cannon-shot.</p>

  From a drawing by Hollar </span> </div>

<p class="space-above"><i>Canterbury.</i>&#8212;There were really two castles at Canterbury in
  quite early times. The first,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[
  120]</a></span> largely perhaps of earthwork, was the work of Duke
  William of Normandy, and was constructed on and near what is now the
  most southern point of the city wall. The purpose of the first castle
  was to dominate and overawe the inhabitants of the city, and also to
  furnish a convenient post for observing the surrounding country. The
  castle was provided with a lofty moated mound for this particular purpose.
  The hill called the Dane John has sometimes been confounded with the
  original mound of the castle, but as a matter of fact the two were
  not related in any way, the castle mound having been destroyed many
  years ago, whilst that known as the Dane John was erected in the eighteenth
  century.</p>
<p>The masonry castle, the ruined keep of which stands to the north-west
  of the earlier castle, was built by Henry II between 1166 and 1174.
  The keep measures in plan 88 feet by 80 feet, and, owing to the upper
  storey having been pulled down in 1817, measures now only 45 feet in
  height. The castle was originally enclosed by a rampart and wall with
  several towers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[
  121]</a></span> and had its own gate to the city, and a barbican on
  its eastern side.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_134.jpg" alt="" height="398" width="600" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 26. CANTERBURY CASTLE IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The city of Canterbury was enclosed by a wall built about the same time
  as the castle (1166-1174). There were seven gates in the wall giving
  access to the city, viz.: (1) Newingate, or St. George&rsquo;s Gate; (2)
  Ridingate; (3) Worthgate; (4) Westgate; (5) Northgate; (6) Burgate;
  and (7) Queeningate. From the evidence of various old engravings it
  is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> apparent
  that several of the gates had been rebuilt at different times. Westgate,
  the only one of the group which now survives, was erected in the reign
  of Richard II, and is an unusually good example of the mediaeval town-gate
  furnished, as it once was, with portcullis, machicolations, and other
  apparatus for defence. It is also a building of great beauty both of
  masonry and proportion.</p>
<p><i>Broadstairs.</i>&#8212;This small town on the north-east coast of Kent,
  which in former times did a good deal of trade in connection with the
  North Sea fishing, still retains considerable traces of a gate, probably
  of the fifteenth century, which commanded the only means of access
  from the harbour to the town through a cutting in the chalk cliff.
  It is known as York Gate, and although altered and repaired, still
  possesses the massive lower part of the original gateway of flint and
  stone, and the grooves for the portcullis.</p>

<p class="space-above"><i>Sandwich.</i>&#8212;The chief traces of the fortifications of this
  ancient and once important town are an earthern rampart or wall of
  considerable<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[
  125]</a></span> extent, a deep fosse, and two interesting and picturesque
  gates.</p>
<p>We know that Sandwich once possessed a castle, and this probably in Anglo-Saxon
  times, but its site is a matter of uncertainty. It must be borne in
  mind that for many centuries Sandwich was the principal port for traffic
  and merchandise to and from the Continent. It possessed a mint in the
  Anglo-Saxon period, doubtless in the castle, and times out of number
  it has taken an important part in repelling invading enemies and in
  preserving the peace and liberty of our shores.</p>
<p>The Fisher Gate, although buried to some depth in an accumulation of soil,
  retains several interesting features. One can still see the grooves
  for its portcullis and the recessed space in its outer wall into which
  the drawbridge fitted when drawn up. The gate is constructed of flints
  and stone, a certain proportion of which are squared blocks of sandstone,
  which from their size and shape may well have been derived from the
  walls of the ruined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[
  126]</a></span> castrum of Richborough, less than two miles distant.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 28. THE BARBICAN GATE, SANDWICH, KENT</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The Barbican is a peculiarly picturesque structure commanding the entrance
  to the town on the south-east side by the ancient ferry across the
  river Stour, which at this point is tidal and often rapid and deep.
  There is a modern bridge. The gateway, which is flanked by two towers
  presenting externally semicircular walls, is largely of Tudor masonry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[
  127]</a></span> arranged in chess-board fashion in black flint and
  grey stone, and long flat bricks. On the southern side of the gateway
  a modern door has been made into the south tower. Splayed embrasures
  commanding the approach are visible within the tower. According to
  local tradition these were intended for cannon. The upper part of the
  gate is a modern restoration in woodwork.</p>
<p>Sandwich originally possessed five gates, but those described are the
  only two which have survived.</p>
<p><i>Dover Castle.</i>&#8212;For the last seven and a half centuries Dover
  Castle has been justly considered a fortress of paramount importance
  in the defence of England. Its site is remarkable for more than one
  reason. The steepness of the chalk cliffs towards the sea, and the
  abruptness of the other slopes, natural and artificial, which encircle
  it on the land side, give a peculiarly difficult, indeed, impregnable
  character to the fortress. The height of the hill on which the castle
  stands close to the narrowest part of the Channel which separates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[
  128]</a></span> our shores from those of the Continent renders it a
  spot of unusual importance for the purposes of observing the approach
  of an enemy coming across the Straits of Dover.</p>
<p>Although there are no certain traces of defensive works on the eastern
  heights of Dover before the time of the Norman Conquest, the natural
  advantages of the site, and Caesar&rsquo;s own words make it probable that
  some kind of camp or look-out post was established at Dover in prehistoric
  times. However, this is a matter of conjecture which lacks the confirmation
  of actual archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>One of the first acts of the Norman Conqueror was to establish his power
  over the English by building earthwork castles, and such a work was
  thrown up on the eastern heights of Dover. Its form and extent are
  unknown, but it may, with reasonable probability, be conjectured that
  its central eminence was that upon which the keep was subsequently
  erected in the reign of Henry II.</p>
<p>Dover Castle, as it exists to-day, presents a good example of the amalgamated
  defences of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[
  129]</a></span> several different architectural periods. Its important
  position as the &ldquo;Clavis et repagulum Angliae,&rdquo; gives it a
  national rather than local importance, and every part of it is of historical
  interest. As a fortress which from Norman times, almost without intermission
  to the present day, has retained its garrison and maintained a foremost
  place in the defence of the realm, Dover Castle deserves more than
  a passing notice in these pages.</p>
<p>During the reign of Henry I (1100-1135) masonry began to take the place
  of earthwork defences, but in due time the need of stronger defences
  became apparent, and during the reign of Henry II (1154-1189) the keep,
  citadel, and defensive works to the north were carried out at the enormous
  expense of nearly £5,000.</p>
<p>The keep, one of the most important of the new works, forms a striking
  feature of the castle. In plan it is practically square, measuring
  98 feet by 96 feet, exclusive of the fore-building, with walls at the
  lowest stage no less than 24 feet in thickness. This is amongst the
  largest buildings of its class in this country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[
  130]</a></span> Each of its three floors, basement, and first and second
  storeys, is occupied by two large apartments, those on the second floor
  being the chief or state apartments and possessing two tiers of windows.</p>
<p>Dover Castle suffered a siege in 1137, and again in 1216. The latter occurred
  under the second constableship of Hubert de Burgh at the hands of the
  Dauphin Louis of France. (See the section on the Cinque Ports, <a href="#Page_196">pp.
  196-204</a>.)</p>
<p>After this siege Dover Castle was strengthened by the construction of
  an additional defensive work, commanding the plateau to the north of
  the castle, and other works, including a subterranean passage, excavated
  in the solid chalk, which still exists. These works were carried out
  between 1220 and 1239. In 1371 a series of important repairs was effected,
  and during the reign of Edward IV the Clopton tower was re-built, and
  a sum of £10,000 was expended in placing Dover Castle in a state of
  thorough repair.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG.
  29. BIRD&rsquo;S-EYE VIEW OF DOVER TOWN AND HARBOUR,<br />
<i>temp.</i> QUEEN ELIZABETH</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Further important works were carried out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[
  131]</a></span> by Henry VIII in connection with his great
  scheme of coast defence. In addition to the strengthening
  of the actual works of the castle, it appears that &ldquo;bulwarks
  under Dover Castle,&rdquo; probably near the level of the
  sea-shore, and a &ldquo;bulwark in the cliff&rdquo; were
  constructed at this period. An interesting plan of Dover,
  made in the time of Queen Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[
  132]</a></span> shows not only the Arckcliffe Bulwark and
  the Black Bulwark, but also the walls and its towers inclosing
  the town of Dover. The plan was published in the sixth
  volume of
  &ldquo;Archaeologia,&rdquo; and is here reproduced in much reduced size
  by permission of the Society of Antiquaries.</p>
<p>In June 1666, and again in July 1667, an invasion of Dover by the Dutch
  fleet was expected. The invasion of this particular part of the sea-coast
  was never carried out, but the castle was provisioned for a siege,
  and it is probable that the actual fortifications were improved and
  augmented.</p>
<p>In the earlier part of the eighteenth century Dover Castle appears to
  have been much neglected, and an engraved view by Buck, published in
  or about the year 1735, indicates that certain parts of it had become
  almost ruinous; but in 1779, owing to the war with our colonies, as
  well as France and Spain, Dover Castle was hastily placed in a state
  of extra defence in order to resist the threatened invasion by our
  enemies.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<p>The period of the Napoleonic menace saw great improvements at Dover Castle.
  Much of the underground work on the north side of the castle, as well
  as in other parts, belongs to this period. Of these and later works
  it is not necessary to speak in this volume. They belong to defences
  which are still effective, and at the present moment Dover Castle may
  be regarded as a fortress of enormous importance in the safe-guarding
  of our shores.</p>
<p><i>Folkestone.</i>&#8212;No traces remain here of defensive work, but
  a castle was built in quite early times, by William de Arcis, for the
  protection of the town. Owing to the fall of the cliffs and the inroads
  of the sea, this has long since been destroyed. It is probable that
  there was some kind of protective work near the mouth of the little
  river which here runs into the sea, but no traces seem to remain.</p>
<p><i>Saltwood.</i>&#8212;Situated about two miles inland from Hythe, this
  castle can hardly be described as a purely coast fortress, but it is
  such a valuable example of the mediaeval castles of its time that it
  deserves special attention. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[
  134]</a></span> must be remembered that the typical mediaeval castle,
  with its elaborate defences, possessed a moral influence out of all
  proportion to its strategic value. As soon as effective charges of
  gunpowder were employed the weakness of mere walls of masonry became
  at once apparent. Explosives were far more effective and disconcerting
  than battering-rams.</p>
<p>Experience extending over many centuries teaches, what has been so thoroughly
  proved by recent events on the Continent, that offensive tactics are
  almost invariably preferable to those of a defensive character, even
  when practised under the protection of the strongest and most elaborate
  fortifications.</p>
<p>Still, as long as the only dangers were starvation and battering-rams,
  the mediaeval castle was as nearly as possible a perfect form of defence.
  Saltwood castle furnishes an excellent example of this.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 530px;"> <img src="images/i_148.jpg" alt="" height="600" width="530" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 30. THE GATE-HOUSE, SALTWOOD CASTLE, KENT</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Its main structure is of late fourteenth century date. Elaborate and complicated
  defences guarded the main entrance to the mediaeval castle. Before
  the unwelcome visitor could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[
  135]</a></span> enter, the following obstacles had to be surmounted.
  First was the gateway in the outer wall of defence, access to which
  was by means of a drawbridge spanning a deep but perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[
  136]</a></span> dry moat. This first gateway was furnished with portcullis,
  and heavy timber doors capable of offering formidable resistance. The
  outer gateway passed, the invaders would proceed across the outer bailey
  towards the inner and far stronger gate-house, exposed all the while
  to such missiles, arrows, cross-bow bolts, etc., as might be projected
  from the battlements and loop-holes of the castle.</p>
<p>Here, at the entrance to the great gatehouse, the moat was generally wide,
  deep, and filled with water. Supposing that the drawbridge was down
  (a most unlikely circumstance), the enemy on approaching the gates
  was confronted by the massive portcullis, and at least two pairs of
  double timber gates beyond it, and whilst forcing the former he would
  be within the range of heavy stones and every kind of dangerous and
  unpleasant missile dropped or thrown from the machicolations situated
  between the flanking towers almost on a level with the battlements
  above. The massive and studded oak doors were constructed of a material
  which was not easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[
  137]</a></span> fired, and they were barred with oak beams of the strength
  and almost the consistency of steel. Even when these were burnt or
  battered down the invaders would encounter a flanking fusilade from
  the lateral passages.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the drawbridge was up, it formed in itself an extremely
  formidable barrier, because by means of chains passing through holes
  in the wall it was drawn close to the gate-house tower and within the
  recess specially made to receive it, leaving the under side of the
  bridge flush with the surface of the gate-house wall.</p>
<p>It may be doubted whether anything in the whole range of military architecture
  furnishes a more perfect system of defence than the gateway, walls,
  ditches, moats, and drawbridges of a mediaeval castle; and it seems
  probable that it would have proved invulnerable against a direct attack
  from without had not the discovery of gunpowder put a new and terrible
  weapon in the hands of the attacking force.</p>
<p>Elaborate precautions were taken to secure the walls of mediaeval castles
  from attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[
  138]</a></span> Experience proved that the massive masonry of Norman
  times was inadequate. A new principle was universally adopted. The
  plan of the castle was so arranged that every part of the enclosing
  wall was commanded by means of mural towers. These additions not only
  added to the passive strength of the work, but also when placed within
  a bow-shot distance enabled the defenders, themselves protected, to
  enfilade the intermediate curtain. Again, the use of curved walls and
  mural towers gave free scope for constructive skill and favoured the
  economical use of building materials.</p>
<p><i>Rye.</i>&#8212;Wall and gates were built by Edward III. Of these the
  Landgate remains. The Ypres Tower, a work of the time of King Stephen,
  also survives. The first wall was built in the time of Richard I, and
  of this there are no traces, whilst of the wall built by Edward III
  one finds very few traces.</p>
<p><i>Winchelsea.</i>&#8212;This town also was formerly walled and defended
  by strong gates. Of the latter three still survive, viz., Strand Gate,
  New Gate, and Land Gate.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Hastings.</i>&#8212;This was the first castle built in England by the
  Normans after the Norman Conquest, and, in accordance with the plan
  of other fortresses of the period, consisted of a mound (shown in the
  Bayeux tapestry) and two, if not three, attached baileys. One of the
  baileys, called &ldquo;Ladies Parlour,&rdquo; is of rather small size,
  comprising little more than one acre, a circumstance which has led
  Mr. Harold Sands, F.S.A., an eminent authority on castles, to infer
  that it could not have been the outer bailey. His inference was confirmed
  by the discovery of the traces of another, and much larger, bailey,
  containing about five acres, situated on the eastern and northern sides.</p>
<p>The masonry part of the castle was probably erected in the years 1171
  and 1172. Further important parts of the castle were subsequently built,
  notably in 1173-4, etc. The fall of the sandstone cliff, due to the
  inroads of the sea, has destroyed a very large part of these works,
  and what remains is a comparatively small part of the area of the castle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>The castle at Hastings mentioned in the
  &ldquo;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&rdquo; as having been built by the order
  of Robert, Earl of Mortain, is not to be confounded with that fortress
  whose ruins crown the hill overlooking Hastings. It was probably situated
  on the shore of the western, or Priory valley at a point near the site
  of the present railway station.</p>
<p>It may not be generally known that in former times Hastings was protected
  on the sea side by a wall. This wall, which had a gateway and portcullis,
  extended from the Castle Hill to the East Hill, and was so arranged
  as to cut off the valley of the Bourne from the shore. A portion of
  the wall is figured as being in existence in 1824, when &ldquo;The History
  and Antiquities of Hastings&rdquo; was published by W. G. Moss. Slight
  traces of the wall may still be seen. The steep character of the hills
  of the Bourne valley rendered walls unnecessary on either side. This
  wall at Hastings is in some ways comparable with the defensive gate
  at Broadstairs already described.</p>
<p>A little to the west of this wall, situated on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[
  141]</a></span> the very edge of the shore, was formerly
  a fort, the memory of which is preserved in local names.</p>
<p><i>Pevensey.</i>&#8212;The Roman castrum here, with its very interesting
  masonry, has been described in the earlier part of this volume. Reference
  has also been made to the construction of a mediaeval castle within
  its area. It has long been supposed that there had been a Norman keep,
  and this has been confirmed by recent excavation and examination of
  the site.</p>
<p><i>Bramber.</i>&#8212;An early earthwork, possibly a Danish camp, at Bramber,
  has already been mentioned. The site was granted by William the Conqueror
  to William de Broase, and a massive castle, of which certain ruins
  remain, was erected by him. It is now, owing to modifications of our
  river systems, somewhat remote from the main stream of the Shoreham
  River (incorrectly called the Adur), but there is every reason to believe
  that at the time of the Danes, and probably long after, it had a direct
  communication by water with the sea. Shoreham itself, it may be added,
  in 1346,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[
  142]</a></span> furnished no less than twenty-six ships for Edward
  III&rsquo;s invasion of France.</p>
<p><i>Portsmouth.</i>&#8212;The existence of remains of the Roman castrum
  at Porchester, situated on the upper waters of Portsmouth Harbour,
  goes to show that in those early times the value of this part of the
  coast as a great harbour was recognized. It is curious, therefore,
  that no town of any importance was built at Portsmouth until the twelfth
  century. The actual building of the town was commenced in the reign
  of Richard I, and a charter was granted in the year 1194. Confirmation
  of this charter was made at various dates by successive sovereigns,
  and important additions to the privileges were made in 1627 by Charles
  I.</p>
<p>The town itself was defended by a wall with towers and gates, the date
  of which is not clear; but from the position of the place on the south
  coast, and open in a peculiar degree to invasion by the French, it
  is reasonable to infer that the defences were made at an early period
  in the history of the town, probably in the thirteenth or fourteenth
  centuries.</p>

<p class="space-above">Leland in his &ldquo;Itinerary&rdquo; describes the defences as consisting
  of a &ldquo;mudde waulle armid with tymbre, whereon be great peaces
  both of yron and brassen ordinaunces.&rdquo; The circuit of the town
  was a mile, and a ditch was constructed outside the wall. Leland records
  that he heard in the town that the defences of the entrance to the
  harbour (&ldquo;the tourres in the hauen mouth&rdquo;) were commenced
  in the reign of Edward IV, continued in the time of Richard II, and
  finished in that of Henry VII. In the time of Edward VI two towers
  of stone were built, one on either side, at the mouth of Portsmouth
  Harbour, and a chain of immense weight and strength was placed between
  them in such a way as to form a defence against the advance of the
  ships of the enemy. The actual chain, with large long links, is shown
  on a plan of Portsmouth of the time of Queen Elizabeth.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

  the Society of Antiquaries has preserved for us the copy of a picture
  which is full of interest, as illustrating the mediaeval walls of Portsmouth
  and the castles, forts, and other works as well as the guns, ammunition,
  and methods of working them, in vogue for the defence of the coast
  about the middle of the sixteenth century. One can see, too, the two

<p><i>Southampton.</i>&#8212;For many years Southampton took such a prominent
  part as a seaport, and was such a favourite town for landing and embarking
  during the Middle Ages, that it would indeed be remarkable if it had
  been left undefended. As a matter of fact its mediaeval walls and towers
  and gates were peculiarly strong. The walls varied from 25 feet to
  30 feet in height, nearly 2,000 yards in length, and was strengthened
  by 29 towers. There were seven principal gates, and four of them, as
  well as large portions of the walls, remain. The gates which remain
  are (1) the North, or Bar-gate; (2) God&rsquo;s House, or South Castle-gate;
  (3) West-gate, and (4) the Postern, now known as Blue Anchor-gate.
  The following have been destroyed: (1) East-gate; (2) Biddle&rsquo;s-gate;
  and (3) the South, or Water-gate. There were also formerly a Castle
  Water-gate (now walled up) and a Postern near the Friary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[
  150]</a></span> and God&rsquo;s House: the site of the latter is lost. The
  mural towers were chiefly drums, or of half-round form. The masonry
  of the wall, to a large extent, is of Norman work, and in some parts
  the walls are rampired, or backed with earth to the summit.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 33. GROUND PLAN OF SOUTHAMPTON</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">The castle at Southampton occupied not only nearly the whole of the north-western
  corner of the area within the town-walls, but also the highest ground.
  Although some authorities have regarded it as a Saxon or Danish castle,
  the weight of evidence seems to be very much in favour of the view
  that it was built very soon after the Norman Conquest. It also seems
  probable that in the first instance it was mainly composed of an artificially-heightened
  mound and other earthworks, crowned, perhaps, by palisades. In due
  course, perhaps in the time of Henry I, a shell-keep of masonry was
  built on the mound, and its wall-footings were carried on massive piers
  of masonry, 8 feet square, and sunk 15 feet into the earth so as to
  have the benefit of the original hard surface. The other parts of the
  castle were built in masonry at about the same time or perhaps within
  the next fifty years.</p>
<p>Southampton suffered much from repeated ravages of the Danes, and from
  various other enemies at different times in the Middle Ages.</p>
<p><i>Wareham.</i>&#8212;The early earthwork defences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[
  152]</a></span> of this ancient town still exist on the
  east, north, and west sides. They consist of a rampart
  of some size with ditch on the outside and another ditch
  of smaller dimensions on the inside. In plan, the earthworks
  take a roughly quadrangular form, except that there is
  no earthwork along the south front facing the River Frome.
  A Norman castle, of which the mound still remains, was
  formerly part of the protection of Wareham. It stood within
  the south-western corner of the town.</p>
<p><i>Bristol.</i>&#8212;Bristol has been a considerable sea-port from quite
  early times, having been engaged in trading from about the year 1000.
  The defences also date from an early period, as might be imagined where
  great wealth and interests were at stake. The date of the first castle
  is unknown, but it is said to have been rebuilt in the reign of King
  Stephen, and in it he himself was imprisoned for nine years. It seems
  probable that the earlier castle was one of the regular Norman defences
  mainly of earth-work, whilst that subsequently built was a masonry
  castle erected to take the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[
  153]</a></span> or to strengthen the earthworks. The keep was square
  and built very strong and massive.</p>
<p>The castle was situated on the eastern side of the town, and on ground
  rising considerably above the level of the river. The town-wall, commencing
  near the west corner of the castle, partially enclosed the town, following
  the main course of the River Frome, and then taking an almost right-angle
  turn to the north-east as far as the bank of the River Avon.</p>
<p>Of the numerous castles and walled towns of Wales it is not, perhaps,
  necessary to speak in these pages, because it is obvious that their
  function was not so much to defend the coast against foreign invaders
  as to establish the power of the English, and to assist in the complete
  conquest of Wales.</p>
<p><i>Lancaster.</i>&#8212;An interesting and important Norman castle<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> was
  built partly without and partly within the southern angle of the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[
  154]</a></span> castrum which was built here long before. The keep
  is of fairly early Norman workmanship. The whole work is perhaps somewhat
  remote from the coast&#8212;a little over four miles, in fact&#8212;but
  being situated on the River Lune, it may well have taken its share
  in coast defence.</p>
<p><i>Liverpool.</i>&#8212;The castle here is believed to have been built
  in the year 1089 by Roger de Poictiers. During the Civil Wars in the
  time of Charles I it was dismantled, and its ruined walls were finally
  pulled down about the year 1725. One or two forts for the protection
  of Liverpool have been subsequently built on the north shore, but they
  have been demolished to make way for new buildings connected with the
  gigantic shipping trade done here.</p>
<p><i>Carlisle.</i>&#8212;The defences of Carlisle are said to date from
  Roman times. The present castle is well situated on the highest point
  of ground within the city, about 60 feet above the river. Its walls
  enclose a roughly triangular space of an extent of about three acres.
  The keep, rectangular in plan, measures 66 feet by 60<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[
  155]</a></span> feet and is at present 68 feet in height. It rose to
  a greater height originally. As one would infer from the dimensions
  of the keep, it is of Norman workmanship, but it has received a good
  many strengthening additions in comparatively recent times. The keep
  is situated in the inner ward which occupies the eastern end of the
  castle enclosure. It is approached by means of two gate-houses, one
  near the middle of the southern wall, leading into the outer ward,
  and the other about the middle of the wall which separates the outer
  and inner ward. The south wall of the castle is of Norman date: the
  other walls are of both Norman and Edwardian construction. The castle
  (doubtless as a fortress comprising mostly earthworks and palisading),
  is attributed to William II. The work was doubtless continued (probably
  in masonry), by Henry I, and completed in 1135 by David, King of Scotland,
  who also heightened the city walls.</p>
<p>Carlisle was, perhaps, only in a very minor sense of any importance as
  one of the coast defences of England. Its castle, its walls, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[
  156]</a></span> other defences were doubtless intended, primarily,
  to keep the Scottish border raiders in check, and to serve as a military
  base against Scotland.</p>
<p>The general principle of defending the coast by means of strong castles
  erected near the shore was in due course extended in accordance with
  local requirements. Thus, Tynemouth Priory, situated on the coast of
  Northumberland, was provided as we have seen, with a gate-house closely
  resembling in form and massive strength the gate-house of a mediaeval
  castle. It is certain that its builders contemplated and provided for
  military defence.</p>
<p>Houses of great personages, and of wealthy institutions such as monastic
  houses were also built on a defensive or semi-defensive scale.</p>

  ON THE EAST COASTS OF KENT AND SUSSEX</a></h3>

<p>During the reign of Henry VIII an interesting group of castles, or more
  properly block-houses, intended entirely for coast defence, was erected
  on the coasts of Kent and Sussex. The particular circumstances which
  gave occasion for these defensive works at this period are quaintly
  set forth by William Lambard in his &ldquo;Perambulation of Kent.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p class="pn">&ldquo;King Henrie the eight, have shaken of the intollerable yoke
    of the Popish tyrannie, and espying that the Emperour was offended,
    for the divorce of Queen Katherine his wife, and that the Frenche
    King had coupled the Dolphine his Sonne to the Popes Niece, and
    married his daughter to the King of Scots, so that he might more
    justly suspect them all, then safely trust any one: determined
    by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[
    160]</a></span> aide of God to stand upon his owne gardes and
    defence, and therefore with all speede, and without sparing any
    cost, he builded Castles, platfourmes, and blocke-houses in all
    needful places of the Realme: And amongest other, fearing least
    the ease, and advantage of descending on land at this part, should
    give occasion and hardinesse to the enemies to invade him, he
    erected (neare together) three fortifications, which might at
    all times keepe and beate the landing place, that is to say,
    Sandowne, Dele, and Wamere.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It appears that on Easter-day 1539 three strange ships appeared in the
  Downs, and as their origin and purpose were alike unknown and suspicious,
  all the able men of Kent rose, and mustered in armour without delay.
  Invasion of the kingdom was feared at any moment, and steps were at
  once taken to put all the havens and possible landing-places in a state
  of defence.</p>
<p>As Lambard mentions, the most prominent of these block-houses, as being
  more immediately opposite the enemy&rsquo;s coast, were Sandown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[
  161]</a></span> (now demolished), Deal, and Walmer. The two latter,
  whilst retaining many of the original features, have been considerably
  modified by alterations and modern additions.</p>
<p>On a coast such as this, extending from Pegwell Bay to Kingsdown, and
  directly facing the nearest shores of the Continent, it would be remarkable
  if no traces were found of defensive works raised to oppose the incursions
  of the enemy. The need of such defences for the protection of the coast
  must have been apparent during a considerable part of the Middle Ages,
  and means were doubtless taken to meet it.</p>
<p>Before the building of the three castles in the reign of Henry VIII, which
  are about to be described, an interesting chain of earthworks of a
  defensive character was thrown up along the coast. The most important
  were the Great, or Black Bulwark, and the Little, or White Bulwark,
  both in the parish of Walmer. There were also two other earthwork forts
  situated between the castles of Deal and Sandown. In addition to these
  there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> was
  a similar fort on the site of each of the three block-houses or castles
  built on this coast.</p>
<p>There must have been many raids by the French and others at various mediaeval
  periods, and it can hardly be doubted that these forts took some part
  in resisting them. Against such an incursion as that feeble attempt
  by Perkin Warbeck in 1495, when the men of Kent in this part of the
  county, and particularly those from Sandwich, beat back the intruders,
  such earthworks as these must have been a valuable means of defence.</p>
<p>Among the State Papers preserved in the Record Office are several which
  give interesting information generally as to the defences set up by
  Henry VIII in 1540.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 38. SANDOWN CASTLE</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">In making a careful examination of these buildings one is struck with
  the fact that we find a certain unity of idea running through the designs
  and plans. Deal, the largest and most complicated of the series on
  the east coast of Kent, has a central circular tower with a diameter
  of 58 feet, and from it project six small inner lunettes and six much
  larger outer lunettes. The walls are no less than 20 feet thick at
  the foundations, and about 11 feet thick at the summit. The whole building
  is surrounded by a moat and was originally approached by a drawbridge.
  The circular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[
  172]</a></span> central tower and the surrounding lunettes, or bastions,
  are roofed with very thick arched masonry work, and are pierced with
  52 port-holes below for scouring the moat, and funnels, or chimneys,
  were conveniently arranged for carrying away the smoke of the fire-arms.
  Larger embrasures were provided for cannon. It is believed that these
  chimney-like openings were intended to be used as machicolations by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[
  173]</a></span> means of which the invaders could be harassed should
  they obtain admission to the fortress.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 39. DEAL CASTLE</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">At Walmer, where the plan resembles that of the destroyed block-house
  of Sandown (the lunettes being four in number), the embrasures for
  cannon are still left in their original condition, although certain
  modern buildings have been erected for residential purposes. Both Deal
  and Walmer retain the chief part of their original encircling moats.
  This is a feature of some interest as pointing to a new stage of development
  in the art of defensive architecture.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[
  174]</a></span> Hitherto, we have seen that the castles which in Norman
  times presented flat surfaces to the invaders&rsquo; engines and battering-rams,
  were superseded by walls having curved surfaces. Curved walls were
  still built in Tudor times, and for precisely the same reason as those
  which were constructed in Edwardian days, but the whole structure of
  the castle was now depressed within a moated enclosure, the aim being
  to avoid presenting much surface to the enemy&rsquo;s fire, cannon by this
  time having become destructive and gunners proficient.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 40. WALMER CASTLE</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Sandown Castle was once the prison of Col. John Hutchinson, the regicide,
  whose life contains a good deal of information as to the dampness and
  darkness of the place. It stood quite close to the sea-shore about
  a mile to the north of Deal, and, after being much damaged by the waves,
  was finally destroyed in 1864. A few indications of its massive strength
  now survive in a chalky mound.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 41. WALMER CASTLE, FROM THE NORTH</span> </div>

<p class="space-above">Sandgate was another of this series of block-houses, its plan being of
  somewhat triangular form owing to the disposition of<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[
  177]</a></span> three towers in reference to the central tower. It
  has been much altered in comparatively recent times (1806), and now
  stands so close to the sea-shore as to be in great danger of being
  destroyed in due course by the waves.</p>

<p class="space-above"><i>Camber.</i>&#8212;Beyond the castles opposite the Downs there was one,
  namely Camber Castle, situated a short distance south-east of Rye,
  Sussex, which belongs to the same period and was built for the same
  purpose as the others. Many years ago, however, it had become decayed
  and useless for coast defence. In 1642 the castle was finally dismantled
  and abandoned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[
  178]</a></span> and the guns were removed. In plan it resembled none
  of the others of the group, having a central tower and four nearly
  completely circular towers placed at regular distances around it. Although
  abandoned for so many years Camber is an excellent example of the kind
  of block-house which was erected by Henry VIII, retaining most of the
  features unaltered by rebuilding.</p>

<p>Another group of defences erected at about this period was designed for
  the defence of the river Thames, the river Medway, and what in later
  times came to be known as the Port of London. These included block-houses
  at Gravesend, Tilbury, Higham, etc.</p>
<p>In 1536 Henry VIII repaired Queenborough Castle and brought its equipment
  up to date, so as to make it a useful part of the coast defence in
  this part of England.</p>
<p>Chatham Dockyard was founded by Queen Elizabeth, and for its protection
  she built Upnor Castle.</p>
<p><i>Upnor Castle.</i>&#8212;This is a rather late form of castle, having
  been built in 1561 by Queen Elizabeth for the defence of the reach
  of the river Medway almost opposite the dockyard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[
  180]</a></span> at Chatham. The engraving of it, here reproduced, shows
  it to have been a castellated building three stories in height, and
  furnished with towers at each end. A platform for guns, defended by
  a stockade, was made in front of the castle close to the edge of the
  river. The forts at Sheerness and Gillingham were built during the
  reign of Charles I.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"> <img src="images/i_193.jpg" alt="" height="434" width="600" />
<span class="caption">FIG. 44. UPNOR CASTLE</span> </div>

<p class="space-above"><i>Landguard Fort</i>, situated on the extreme south-eastern corner of
  Suffolk, was erected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[
  181]</a></span> about the beginning of the reign of Charles I, in order
  to command the mouth of the combined estuaries of the Rivers Orwell
  and Stour. The first fort having been demolished, new works were built
  in 1718, and eight small towers, each mounting three guns, were erected
  on the adjacent coast in 1806. Owing to undermining by the sea some
  of these towers were destroyed twenty or thirty years after they were
  built.</p>
<p><i>Brighton.</i>&#8212;In the year 1558, in consequence of the frequent
  incursions and depredations of the French, the people of Brighton determined
  to erect fortifications for the defence of the place. A site was selected
  on the low cliff between Black Lion Street and Ship Street, and about
  215 yards westward of East Street. Upon this was erected a circular
  block-house, as it was called, containing in the main storage for arms
  and ammunition. Beyond it, towards the sea, was a small battery comprising
  four pieces of large ordnance.</p>
<p>It is somewhat surprising to learn that in addition to these fortifications
  against enemies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[
  182]</a></span> Brighton possessed three gates, viz., (1) the East
  Gate and Portal at the south end of East Street, (2) the Middle Gate,
  opposite the end of Middle Street, and (3) the West Gate, opposite
  the end of West Street.</p>

<p>Along the south coast, particularly in the neighbourhood of Portsmouth,
  another group of coast defences specially designed to protect the extremely
  important naval base of Portsmouth Harbour, was built by Henry VIII.
  They comprised the block-houses or castles of Southsea, Hurst, Calshot,
  and <a name="in_the" id="in_the">in the</a> Isle of Wight, Cowes, Sandown, and
  Yarmouth.</p>

<span class="caption">FIG. 45. HURST CASTLE</span> </div>

<p class="space-above"><i>Southsea Castle</i>, situated about three-quarters of a mile to the
  south or south-east of Portsmouth, was built by Henry VIII in 1539.
  The original castle consisted of a block-house with a dome-like top.
  Additions to it in the form of a star-fort were made in the time of
  Charles I. It was repaired and<span class="pagenum"> <a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[
  185]</a></span> enlarged on the accession of the House of Hanover.</p>
<p>The castle was situated on the level ground quite near the sea-shore and
  was apparently selected with a view to commanding the approach of ships
  from the east in the direction of Portsmouth.</p>
<p><i>Fort Cumberland</i> is a more modern defence, having been built in
  1746 and enlarged in 1794.</p>
<p><i>Hurst Castle</i>, a fortress of considerably larger size than those
  on the east coast, is situated on the Solent, and was built specially
  to defend the approach to Southampton Harbour against the French. Its
  building was commenced in 1541 and finished in 1544. The fortress was
  of some importance during the Civil War, and served for some days as
  the prison of Charles I. Towards the end of the seventeenth century
  it mounted nearly thirty guns. Several alterations have been made to
  it from time to time. Both Hurst Castle and Cowes Castle were built
  with materials derived from the fabric of Beaulieu Abbey.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>
<p><i>Calshot Castle</i> was a small fort built in the time of Henry VIII
  with stones taken from the ruins of Beaulieu Abbey. Its special function
  was to defend Southampton Water. Certain additions were made during
  the reign of Queen Elizabeth, but the site chosen for the castle was
  most unsuitable, owing to proximity to the sea-shore.</p>
<p><i>Cowes</i> (<i>West</i>).&#8212;The fortress here, built in 1539, possessed
  a semicircular battery and mounted eight pieces of heavy ordnance.
  Its situation was excellently chosen for defensive purposes.</p>
<p><i>Sandown.</i>&#8212;The blockhouse here, erected between 1537 and 1540,
  was built on a site close by the sea, and received much damage in consequence.
  It appears to have possessed a landing-stage, as in the year 1618 timber
  was supplied for mending the pier and planking the platform. Sandown
  Fort was built on a site a little more remote from the sea in 1631-2.</p>
<p><i>Yarmouth</i> (<i>Little</i>).&#8212;This castle, which was built somewhat
  later than other members of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[
  187]</a></span> the group to which it belongs, was finished in 1547.
  The need for it seems to have been suggested by a raid by the French
  in the Isle of Wight in 1543. In 1586, and again in 1599, it was strengthened
  by the addition of earthwork defences.</p>
<p><i>Weymouth or Sandsfort Castle.</i>&#8212;This castle is situated on
  an eminence to the south of Weymouth, and commands extensive views
  over Portland Bay or Road. It was erected by Henry VIII in 1539 or
  1540.</p>
<p><i>Portland Castle.</i>&#8212;As early as the reign of William Rufus a
  castle is supposed to have existed here. It has long been known by
  the name of Bow-and-Arrow Castle, although locally it is sometimes
  called Rufus&rsquo;s Castle. Its origin and date are not quite clearly known,
  but it is evidently a work of considerable antiquity, and was probably
  intended for the defence of the coast.</p>
<p>Henry VIII built a new castle here in 1520, on his return from the interview
  with Francis I, usually called &ldquo;the Field of the Cloth of Gold.&rdquo; Its
  purpose was to protect the coast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[
  188]</a></span> here in connection with Sandsfort or Sandsfoot Castle.</p>
<p>In 1588 the fortress was garrisoned in expectation of a landing by the
  Spanish Armada. It figured, too, in the Civil Wars of the time of Charles
  I.</p>
<p><i>Holy Island.</i>&#8212;Of the two castles on Holy Island, one, known
  as the Fort of Beblowe, was erected in or soon after the year 1539,
  and doubtless belongs to the great series of coast defences set up
  by Henry VIII. The other castle belonged to a subsequent period, and
  is believed to have been built in 1675.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact, that of all the block-houses built on the coast,
  or even in the estuaries of rivers, by Henry VIII, built, as we know
  from documentary evidence, at enormous cost, there is absolutely no
  record of any of them having been of real value in destroying the enemies&rsquo;
  shipping. From some not a single shot was ever fired, except, perhaps,
  during the Civil War, when King and Parliament were at variance, and
  also upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[
  189]</a></span> the occasions of public rejoicings, such as royal birthdays,
  proclamations of peace, etc.</p>
<p>It says much for the intimate knowledge of the distribution of our defences
  that the Dutch, when they invaded our shores in 1667, steered clear
  of these castles, and made straight for the Medway, rather than for
  Portsmouth or Dover, or the east coast of Kent, where there were castles
  of the Henry VIII period, and later, guarding the shores.</p>
<p>One point in the construction of these block-houses which must arrest
  the notice of every one who pays any attention to the subject, is the
  excellent illustrations they afford as to modification of military
  architecture due to the introduction of gunpowder. This explosive substance
  which revolutionized military tactics as soon as the art of using it
  and of making suitable fire-arms had reached perfection, was probably
  invented or discovered in the thirteenth century. For many years, however,
  its possibilities were imperfectly understood, and its employment was
  more dangerous to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[
  190]</a></span> those who used it than to those against whom it was
  used.</p>
<p>The castle-building towards the end of the fourteenth century&#8212;say
  the reign of Richard II&#8212;was distinctly influenced by the new
  force employed in attack and sieges. Curves become the fashion instead
  of flat walls, and by the sixteenth century, when Henry VIII erected
  this great series of block-houses, we find that every means was taken
  to avoid presenting much surface to the action of cannon-shot. The
  walls were all curved to ensure the shot glancing off, and the whole
  structure was sunk in a moat, and built in very strong masonry, and
  with no more height than was necessary.</p>
<p><i>Martello Towers.</i>&#8212;One of the last types of masonry fortifications
  to be erected, as distinguished from structures which are known as
  forts and redoubts, was also in idea one of the most ancient. Martello
  Towers, of which so many were built on the coast of Essex, Kent, and
  Sussex, were based on the model of a tower on Cape Martello, on the
  Gulf of San<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[
  191]</a></span> Fiorenzo, in Corsica. They are built of solid masonry,
  but contain vaulted rooms for the garrisons. They are furnished with
  a flat platform on top for two or three guns, and access to them is
  by means of a ladder leading to a side doorway, about twenty feet above
  the level of the ground. In some cases a deep ditch was cut round the
  towers.</p>
<p>Many of these coast defences were erected on the south-eastern shores
  of England as a protection against the expected naval invasion under
  Napoleon I.</p>
<p>The whole coast in the neighbourhood of Folkestone, Sandgate, and Hythe,
  and at other points, was defended in this way by Martello Towers, forts,
  and earthworks, with a view of resisting Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion. At the
  same period a great military canal was constructed from Hythe, extending
  inland to Appledore, and then on to Rye in Sussex.</p>

<h3 class="mf"><a name="THE_NAVY" id="THE_NAVY">THE NAVY</a></h3>

<p>The scope of the present volume is to review the defensive works which
  have been carried out in various ages for the protection of our shores
  against incursions of enemies: the story of our naval exploits does
  not primarily come within it.</p>
<p>The first duty of our English navy is, and always has been, offensive,
  as well as defensive. In times of peace we have been accustomed to
  regard our Navy as our first line of defence, and this is a perfectly
  accurate description of its functions. But it is obvious that these
  functions have always been different from, and in most periods independent
  of, what is generally understood by the term coast defences.</p>
<p>Yet, again and again, the coast fortresses have assisted the operations
  of our war-ships when resisting the enemy, and to a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[
  196]</a></span> extent the two forces have always been, and possibly
  always will be closely connected.</p>
<p>Reference to the story of the Roman fleet for the defence of the shore
  of Britain, and also to the English navy under King Alfred, has already
  been made, but the beginning of the English navy may be traced to a
  somewhat later period. It had its origin in the Cinque Ports.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3 class="mf"><a name="THE_CINQUE_PORTS" id="THE_CINQUE_PORTS">THE CINQUE PORTS</a></h3>

<p>The association of certain towns on the south-east shores of England for
  the purpose of coast defence is of great antiquity. In the oldest Cinque
  Ports charter on record, granted in the sixth year of Edward I, reference
  is made to documents of the time of Edward the Confessor, indicating
  an origin before the Norman Conquest.</p>
<p>In early times there were, as the name implies, five ports included in
  this confederation, viz.: Hastings, Sandwich, Dover, Romney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[
  197]</a></span> and Hythe. Almost immediately after the Norman Conquest,
  Winchelsea and Rye were added with status equal to the original towns.
  Thereafter the precise title of the corporation was &ldquo;the five
  Cinque Ports and two ancient towns.&rdquo; In addition to these seven
  head ports, there were eight corporate members, viz.: Deal, Faversham,
  Folkestone, Fordwich, Lydd, Pevensey, Seaford and Tenterden, and no
  less than twenty-four non-corporate members.</p>
<p>The jurisdiction of the Cinque Ports extended from Reculver on the north
  coast of Kent to Seaford on the south coast of Sussex. It will be noticed
  that at least three of the corporate members are situated at some little
  distance from the sea coast. Faversham, Fordwich, and in a greater
  degree Tenterden are inland towns, although two are placed on river-courses
  which afford access to the sea.</p>
<p>As will presently be seen, men as well as ships were contributed by the
  Cinque Ports for the defence of the realm, and Tenterden received its
  charter in 1449, in order that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[
  198]</a></span> might assist Rye to discharge its obligations. Hence
  it is that we find a corporate member situated so far from the coast.</p>
<p>The Cinque Ports were established primarily for the defence of the sea-board
  on the south-east of England, but in the course of time their purpose
  was extended. In these early times, when England possessed no regular
  navy, it was the men of the Cinque Ports who guarded our seas. They
  provided, in return for many privileges they received from the Crown,
  almost the only form of naval defence which England possessed until
  the reign of Henry VII. Until that period nearly all the men and ships
  which guarded our shores from the enemy were furnished by the Cinque
  Ports, and even after the time of Henry VII they rendered important
  assistance to the regular navy.</p>
<p>The men of the Cinque Ports seem to have carried on a certain amount of
  privateering at various times, but there have been times when their
  skill in seafaring and their undoubted courage have been employed in
  work of the utmost value in the defence of England. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[
  199]</a></span> celebrated occasion occurred in the year 1217, when
  Hubert de Burgh, having selected the best seamen of the Cinque Ports,
  set out with about sixteen large ships and twenty small ones to attack
  the approaching fleet of Louis the Dauphin of France, the numbers of
  which were no less than eighty large and many smaller vessels. Hubert
  de Burgh had grasped the important principle of naval strategy that
  in order to free his country from the danger of invasion, it was above
  all things necessary to attack and destroy the enemy&rsquo;s force at sea.</p>
<p>Although opposed by such unequal numbers the Englishmen skilfully secured
  a windward position, bore down upon the enemy as they shaped their
  course for the English coast, threw quicklime in their eyes, poured
  into the enemy a volley of arrows from the long bows for which the
  English were famous, and scattered and destroyed the enemy&rsquo;s ships,
  so that only about seventeen escaped; fifty-five were captured, and
  the rest were sunk. The credit of this signal victory in an engagement
  at sea which may rank as almost the first in English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[
  200]</a></span> history, certainly the first subsequently to the time
  of King Alfred, belongs to the men of the Cinque Ports.</p>
<p>The strength of the Cinque Port forces in the fourteenth century may be
  gathered from the fact that at the Siege of Calais (1347), when the
  fleet was called out to assist in the blockade and to defend the Channel,
  the following ships and men were furnished by the Cinque Ports:</p>

<p>Among the privileges of the Cinque Ports to which reference has been made
  there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[
  201]</a></span> one or two which point unmistakably to an early origin.
  One is the right of open-air assembling in portmote or parliament at
  Shepway Cross, and afterwards at Dover, where by-laws were made for
  the governance of the confederation, the regulation of the Yarmouth
  fisheries, and to give decisions in all cases of treason, sedition,
  illegal coining, and concealment of treasure-trove. The ordinary business
  was transacted in two courts, named respectively the Court of Brotherhood,
  and the Court of Brotherhood and Guestling. The formal installation
  of a newly appointed Lord Warden took place at the Breding Stone at
  Dover, also in open-air assembly. It is an interesting fact that these
  moots or open-air assemblies were summoned by the sound of a horn.</p>
<p>The Lord Warden, who is the chief officer of the Cinque Ports, combining
  therewith the governorship of Dover Castle and maritime jurisdiction
  as admiral of the ports, may be regarded as representing to some extent
  the ancient office of Count of the Saxon Shore, although the changes
  of time and the paramount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[
  202]</a></span> importance of the Royal Navy in more recent times in
  the work of defending our shores, have tended to rob the office of
  much of its former importance. At the present time the actual duties
  of the post are confined to presiding as chairman of the Dover Harbour
  Board.</p>
<p>The freemen or &ldquo;Barons&rdquo; of the Cinque Ports are often mentioned
  in connection with this subject, and it may be useful to put on record
  the following precise account of the subject, written by Mr. Charles
  Dawson, F.S.A.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
  <p class="pn" style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">A Note on the
    Titular Rank of the Barons of the Cinque Ports</span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Freemen of each of the Cinque Ports have from ancient
    times been termed &lsquo;Barons,&rsquo; because they held their lands and
    privileges as joint Tenants-in-chief of the Crown, by fealty
    and special Military (Naval) Service. Their title was almost
    unique, in this sense, that as joint tenants of their Baronies
    they were not like the individual Barons of the Realm, but Barons-corporate.</p>
  <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>
  <p>&ldquo;When summoned to the King&rsquo;s councils, the Barons were addressed
    collectively by writ, a copy of which was forwarded to each Cinque
    Port.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Simon de Montfort&rsquo;s general summons to Parliament was addressed
    to &lsquo;the Earls and Barons of the whole of the Kingdom and of the
    Cinque Ports,&rsquo; and in the year 1293 the Barons of the Cinque
    Ports claimed of King Edward I to be tried for their alleged
    delinquencies by &lsquo;their Peers, Earls and Barons.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The title of Baron did not, of course, apply to every Freeman
    of the Cinque Ports in an individual sense, except so far as
    individuals represented, by election, the whole of their Combarons
    at each respective Cinque Port.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the earlier Parliaments the order of nomination ranked
    the Barons of the Cinque Ports above the Commoners, and with
    the Barons of the Realm, the scale of their fines for non-attendance
    being identical with that of the Bishops and Barons of the Realm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There yet remains one ancient custom which identifies the
    rank of the Barons of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[
    204]</a></span> Cinque Ports with the Peers of the Realm, namely:&#8212;that
    when their representatives perform their services to the Sovereign
    at the Coronation, within the Abbey Church of Westminster, they
    are entitled to assume their head dress at the same moment as
    do the Peers of the Realm, and immediately after the Crown has
    been placed on the Sovereign&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="mf"><a name="DEFENSIVE_CHAINS_ETC" id="DEFENSIVE_CHAINS_ETC">DEFENSIVE CHAINS, ETC.</a></h3>

<p><i>The Chain at Chatham.</i>&#8212;When, early in the seventeenth century,
  Chatham had grown to considerable importance as a naval centre, a curious
  method of defence was devised. A long and stout iron chain was placed
  across the Medway at the western end of Gillingham Reach, near Upnor
  Castle, with the idea of effectually stopping the progress of alien
  ships up the river beyond this point. When the chain was originally
  placed here is not exactly known, but it was repaired in 1606, and
  soon after abandoned. In 1623 the chain was superseded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[
  205]</a></span> by a boom made up of masts, iron, and cordage. A few
  years later, in 1635, either a new boom or a new chain was placed across
  Gillingham Reach.</p>
<p>The chain came into great prominence when the Dutch invaded the Thames
  estuary and the Medway in 1667. It was fixed up at Gillingham either
  on 27 April or soon afterwards. The published accounts are not quite
  clear or consistent. The claws for fastening and heaving it up were
  expected to arrive but apparently were not forthcoming on the date
  mentioned.</p>
<p>Although there had been a great chain here before it does not appear to
  have been stretched properly across the river. This was now attended
  to under the direction of the Duke of Albemarle, who went down to Chatham
  posthaste to complete the defensive works. The chain, consisting of
  links made of iron bars, six inches in circumference, was strained
  probably in such a way that it would not be visible above water, and
  it was perhaps buoyed at intervals. A small battery of guns was placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[
  206]</a></span> on shore at each end of the chain in order to protect
  it from injury by the Dutch. The <i>Unity</i>, a warship, was stationed
  to the east of the chain, whilst on the west side a Dutch prize was
  sunk, and several ships were on guard.</p>
<p>The Dutch ships, which had been observed off the English coast 26 April
  1667, and off Harwich 8 June, now approached. A letter amongst the
  State Papers in the Record Office, dated 20 June 1667, tells us that
  the Dutch fleet was seen off Harwich on the 6 June, but the only result
  was that a few fishermen were frightened, and that some of the Dutchmen
  landed and drove off some cattle. On the 10th the navy came within
  shot of Sheerness, and after some hours took the guns. On the 11th,
  by degrees, twenty or twenty-two Dutch ships were brought up to the
  narrow part of the river Medway, where ships had been sunk. Two and
  a half hours fighting on the following day made the Dutch masters of
  the chain. One guard ship after another was fired and blown up. The
  chain was broken by Captain Brackel by order of Van Ghent. Fire-ships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[
  207]</a></span> were sent to destroy the English ships. The first hung
  on the chain, but the weight of the second snapped it. The Dutch ships
  went forward carrying destruction with them. The batteries on the banks
  of the river and the guns from. Upnor Castle were now brought into
  action, with the result that the enemy soon retired, leaving two ships
  stranded.</p>
<p>The exploits of the Dutch in the Thames and the Medway caused considerable
  alarm in London. Pepys, on hearing of the failure of the chain of Chatham,
  writes of it as a very serious piece of news, &ldquo;which,&rdquo; he
  says,
  &ldquo;struck me to the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another and rather more precise account of the occurrence is as follows:
  On 12 June the Dutch sent up towards Gillingham a division consisting
  of four men-of-war, three armed yachts, and two fire-ships. Several
  of the ships charging at the same time, broke the chain, entered the
  waters beyond and set fire to the Mathias. The Dutch next dealt with
  the batteries at either end of the chain, and by means of their guns
  quickly silenced them. Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[
  208]</a></span> damage was done to the shipping in the Medway, many
  vessels being burnt and destroyed.</p>
<p>It seems probable that at least one purpose of the chain was to hinder
  the progress of fire-ships which the enemy set in motion against our
  shipping.</p>
<p>In order to defend the government works nearer London, batteries mounting
  sixty pieces of ordnance were erected at Woolwich, whilst the defensive
  works at Gravesend and Dover were strengthened.</p>
<p>About the middle of the following September workmen were employed in clearing
  away the moorings of the chain at Gillingham Reach.</p>
<p><i>Chains at Portsmouth, Great Yarmouth, etc.</i>&#8212;The chain of Chatham
  furnishes a curious example of coast defence, wholly ineffective against
  powerful shipping; but it was not a novelty. Portsmouth Harbour had
  been at an earlier period provided with a similar form of defence.
  Edward VI, on the occasion of a visit to Southsea Castle, determined
  to strengthen Portsmouth against invasion by the enemy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[
  209]</a></span> He therefore directed the building of two massive towers
  at the entrance to the harbour. To these an immense iron chain was
  fixed in such a way that it could be raised and tightened or lowered
  at pleasure when the approach of the enemy made this desirable. The
  fortifications of Portsmouth were strengthened during the reign of
  Elizabeth (see <a href="#Page_145">p. 145</a>).</p>
<p><i>Great Yarmouth.</i>&#8212;In addition to a boom and two timber jetties
  at the entrance to the haven, Yarmouth possessed a chain for the protection
  of its shipping.</p>
<p><i>Hull</i> possessed a chain, and an actual picture of it is preserved
  in one of the Cotton MSS.</p>
<p><i>Cowes</i> also was defended by a chain.</p>
<p><i>Fowey.</i>&#8212;For the protection of this town Edward IV erected
  two towers to carry a chain which was suspended, doubtless under the
  level of the water, across the haven, or mouth of the River Fowey.
  Subsequently the people of Fowey incurred the royal disapproval when
  they attacked the French during a truce, and accordingly Edward IV
  had the chain removed and sent to Dartmouth. It does not seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[
  210]</a></span> quite clear whether this chain, when removed to Dartmouth,
  was used for the protection of shipping, but there certainly was a
  chain bridge at this place in which, conceivably, the old chain may
  have been utilized.</p>
<p>There is reason to think that chains for the protection of important centres
  of shipping were more common than might be supposed from the few definite
  particulars of them which have survived. As an effective defence against
  the approach of the war-ships of an enemy, however, it would perhaps
  be impossible to find a more feeble type of protection.</p>
<p><i>Booms.</i>&#8212;As we have already observed in dealing with chains,
  the necessity must have been felt of supporting such very heavy barriers,
  even under water and by means of buoys. The boom, although introduced
  quite early, must have been an improvement upon the simple iron chain,
  because it contained, to some extent, its own means of support. This
  contrivance, a chain of linked up massive timbers reinforced with iron,
  and armed with iron spikes was employed, as early as the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[
  211]</a></span> Queen Elizabeth at Great Yarmouth, and subsequently
  at many other ports. Like the chain it, of course, provided an obstruction
  to navigation, especially at the mouths of rivers and harbours; but
  its massive iron spikes, calculated to pierce and damage shipping,
  gave it a distinct advantage over the chain.</p>
<p><i>Fire-ships</i>.&#8212;These were ships filled with combustibles and
  explosives sent to drift among the shipping of the enemy. In the action
  off Gravelines, fire-ships were used with considerable moral effect
  against the remains of the Spanish Armada, and they materially assisted
  in breaking up the sea-power of the Spaniards. Seven vessels were charged
  with combustibles and primed with gunpowder. As they neared the Spanish
  ships their appearance created panic. The Spaniards, in order to avoid
  the danger of fire, cut their ships adrift, and serious damage was
  caused by the collisions which ensued.</p>
<p>In 1667, again, fire-ships were employed in the daring raid made by the
  Dutch in the Thames and Medway. This time they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[
  212]</a></span> used by the Dutch near the chain at Gillingham Reach.</p>
<p><i>Catamarans.</i>&#8212;Another method of firing an enemy&rsquo;s shipping
  was by means of a kind of raft charged with combustibles. The idea
  of the Catamaran, as regards both its name and construction, was borrowed
  from the coasts of India and Ceylon where a raft made of three long
  timbers lashed together, the middle timber being the longest, is used
  for fishing purpose. As adapted for destroying shipping the Catamaran
  may be described as a kind of floating mine. Catamarans were much favoured
  by Mr. Pitt, and in 1804 they were employed by the English against
  the French fleet, but they proved unsuccessful.</p>

<h3 class="mf"><a name="THE_COASTGUARD" id="THE_COASTGUARD">THE COASTGUARD</a></h3>

<p>The coastguard force is of great antiquity, although it is not known at
  what period it was instituted. In 1403-4 (5 Henry IV, c. 3) it was
  enacted by statute</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">
  <p>&ldquo;That the Watch to be made upon the Sea Coast through the Realm
    shall be made by the Number of the People, in the Places, and
    in Manner and Form, as they were wont to be made in Times past
    and that in the same Case the Statute of Winchester<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> be
    observed and kept.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>There is every reason to believe that there was a properly organized coastguard
  force at a much earlier period, although precise information on the
  subject is not available. Certain manuscripts relating to the defence
  of the coast of Norfolk, however, indicate the existence of a coastguard
  in that county as, early as the thirteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>
<p>In more recent times the duties of the coastguards included the suppression
  of smuggling and the aiding of shipwrecked vessels. Another purpose
  was to serve as a reserve to the navy: but in earlier times the prevention
  and suppression of smuggling was the main work of the coastguards.
  Early in the nineteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[
  214]</a></span> century a coast blockade was established on the coasts
  of Kent and Sussex, and detachments of men and boats were stationed
  at the Martello Towers on the sea-coast.</p>
<p>It is time, perhaps, to bring these pages on the coast defences of England
  to a conclusion, and to review very briefly the chief features of the
  subject. There are one or two points which stand out with peculiar
  prominence.</p>
<p>Firstly we are struck by the origin, development, deterioration, and final
  degradation in the methods of coast defence. In the middle and later
  periods of the Roman occupation of Britain the fortresses for coast
  defence were built in massive masonry. In the earliest examples reliance
  was placed alone in mass and weight, and no attempt was made to protect
  the wall by enfilading. In the works built later on this defect was
  made good. Protecting bastions gave opportunity of attacking the invaders
  in flank, and so protecting the wall. In the Norman period, again,
  and particularly in its earlier part massive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[
  215]</a></span> keeps of great strength and height were erected for
  the dual purpose of resisting the enemy by passive force, and of keeping
  a good look-out over the surrounding country or sea, by means of which
  movements of the enemy could be discovered.</p>
<p>In the periods which followed, notably from the reign of Henry II to that
  of Richard II, the art of building castles was constantly being improved
  and developed. Defensive works were adapted to the new forms and methods
  of offence.</p>
<p>From that time downward to the first few years of the nineteenth century
  there is every indication of decadence. The defences became more and
  more feeble. The &ldquo;chain,&rdquo; as a serious bar to the progress
  of unwelcome shipping, reached its most absurd and ridiculous stage
  during the time of the Dutch invasion of the Medway in 1667, when the
  &ldquo;Chain of Chatham&rdquo; was snapped without the slightest difficulty
  by the Dutch ships.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, as we have seen, the coast blockhouses erected by
  Henry VIII<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[
  216]</a></span> have never taken any important part in the defence
  of our coasts. This is mainly due, not to their inefficiency, but to
  the absence of opportunity. The same is true of the Martello towers
  erected along our south-eastern coast when invasion from France, under
  Napoleon I, was anticipated.</p>
<p>History is full of accounts of attempted invasions of England. Up to the
  period of the Norman Conquest, wellnigh every attempt to land on our
  shores was eventually, although not always immediately, successful.
  But from the Norman Conquest downward England has always been strong
  enough to protect herself from enemies who have attempted to make a
  permanent settlement. This is due to the fact that whilst we have not
  neglected our coast defences, we have not relied on castles, forts,
  and other forms of land defence. We have maintained a powerful fleet
  of war vessels as our first line of defence. Experience has made it
  abundantly clear that coast defence without the aid of a powerful navy
  would be inadequate to protect our shores. Our navy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[
  217]</a></span> is, and always must be, the first and most important
  of our defences, and its special business is not to act as a simple
  coastguard force, but to seek out the enemy&rsquo;s naval force where-ever
  it may be, and destroy it.</p>

    way of fighting-with their chariots is this: first they drive
    their chariots on all sides, and throw their darts, insomuch
    that by the very terror of the horses, and noise of the wheels,
    they often break the ranks of the enemy. When they have forced
    their way into the midst of the cavalry, they quit their chariots
    and fight on foot: meanwhile the drivers retire a little from
    the combat, and place themselves in such a manner as to favour
    the retreat of their countrymen, should they be overpowered by
    the enemy. Thus in action they perform the part both of nimble
    horsemen and stable infantry; and by continual exercise and use
    have arrived at that expertness, that in the most steep and difficult
    places they can stop their horses upon a full stretch, turn them
    which way they please, run along the pole, rest on the harness,
    and throw themselves back into their chariots with incredible
    dexterity.&rdquo; (&ldquo;Comm. on the Gallic War,&rdquo; iv, xxix).</p>
